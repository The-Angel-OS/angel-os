## üé¨ **EPISODE DESCRIPTION**

This is the RAW, unfiltered dashcam footage of what happens when your Egyptian roommate calls you at the last minute for a beach adventure. Think "Harold & Kumar Go to White Castle" but it's "Ken and Ahmed Go to Clearwater Beach" - and it gets WILD.

### üö® **THE BACKSTORY** 
Last night Ahmed calls me while I'm coincidentally driving through Dunedin on my evening domain survey. He and Erica aren't fighting, but he's drunk and wants to be picked up. Things go sideways FAST when he opens a Four Loko in my car, I yell at him, and he literally gets out at Coachman and Belcher because he didn't like being told not to drink in the vehicle. 

I went to Walmart (with Diesel and Mila still in the car), then picked him back up because leaving someone stranded is a dick move. When we got back to the apartment, he walked off all mad, came back in, and then... 

**AT 3:00 AM** - while I'm still working on Angel OS - this man walks into the kitchen and **LITERALLY URINATES IN THE SILVERWARE DRAWER**. His intended target? Tyler's baked potato that was going into the microwave. 

You can't make this stuff up! ü§¶‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
