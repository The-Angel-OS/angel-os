Clearwater Cruisin’ Home Show — Episode 4: Harold (Ken) & Kumar (Ahmed) Go to White Castle (John’s Complete Auto Center)

End‑of‑day Soul Quest turns into a parking‑lot side quest. After singing “A Song About Enterprise Dog Park” in the USS Enterprise (Soul Van 1), we realize we’re locked out — while it’s still running. We borrow a pro vehicle access kit (air bladder, shim, rods), meet good people, roll 25 minutes of interviews, and capture the exact moment the lock pops on camera. By the end: van open, quest logged, spell cast — XP in problem‑solving, patience, and people. Even the detours are sacred.
