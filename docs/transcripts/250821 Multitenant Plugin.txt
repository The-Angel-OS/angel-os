hey there I want to take a second to
0:03
talk about the multi-tenant plugin that
0:05
we just released for payload if you
0:06
don't know what multitenant is it's when
0:08
you have in most cases clients you're
0:12
spitting out websites and you want your
0:14
clients to log into the same admin panel
0:16
but you don't want them to see each
0:17
other's content or maybe you work in a
0:20
business and you have different
0:21
organizations and you don't want the
0:22
organizations to see each other's you
0:25
know they want you want them to stay
0:26
focused on the thing that they are set
0:29
out to do so that's kind of what multi-
0:31
tendency does it allows you to separate
0:33
um users and this plugin helps do that
0:37
in a fairly easy way so we have a
0:40
tenants collection a users collection
0:42
food items collection and a food menu
0:45
collection tenants collection you have
0:46
to add a tenants
0:48
collection and I've already done this
0:51
here my example is restaurants so I have
0:53
two clients and they are in the
0:55
restaurant business so steelcat blue dog
0:58
they're two restaurants
1:00
I can assign users to a restaurant so if
1:02
I go to users I have hu and Jane hu is
1:05
assigned to steelcat and Jane is
1:08
assigned to Blue Dog and when Jane logs
1:12
in Jane will only be able to see blue
1:14
dog related content and when H logs in
1:16
you will only be able to see steelcat
1:18
related content I'm logged in as a super
1:20
admin so if I look at my account here I
1:23
just have a rule as
1:25
admin we the plugin allows you to Define
1:28
exactly how you determine who what users
1:30
are super admin so this is not like
1:32
strict to you need to use this field um
1:34
but in my example this is just what I'm
1:36
doing and as a super admin I can go to a
1:39
collection and I can see all items for
1:42
every tenant or I can filter down by
1:44
like blue dog and only see the blue dog
1:47
items and then same for
1:49
steelcat um two more things two quick
1:52
things it also allows you
1:54
to kind of come up with like a global
1:57
pattern so with tenant you can't have a
2:00
global um config because collect because
2:04
you need to have multiple documents and
2:06
they just need to be one per tenant
2:08
instead of a global which is like one
2:11
document that the whole that everybody
2:13
shares that doesn't really work for
2:15
tenancy so you have there's a way to
2:18
Mark collections as globals and when you
2:20
do that you get and you click on this
2:22
one this one's marked as Global there's
2:24
no list view it goes right to the
2:26
document and then if I switch to blue
2:28
dog goes right to the blue dog
2:30
which is pretty cool and then when Jane
2:32
logs in she will only be able to go to
2:34
the blue dog he will only be able to go
2:36
to the steel capat the last thing here
2:38
is uh relationship filter options so
2:41
this is built into baked into the
2:44
plugin so this is a I'm on the blue dog
2:48
tenant and this is a relationship field
2:50
to food items which has a tenant field
2:53
on it and so it filters all the items
2:56
based on the tenant that I currently
2:58
have selected so if if I change this to
3:00
Steel cat you'll see that the items are
3:03
different these are the steelcat items
3:06
which is just like a boiler plate that
3:07
you don't need to worry about when you
3:09
use this plugin but you would need to
3:10
worry about if you were rolling your own
3:11
multi-tenancy
3:13
solution um that's really all I have the
3:17
only thing I could probably show you is
3:19
when I log in as let's say Jane there's
3:22
no selector because she only has one
3:24
tenant she can only see her tenant she
3:27
can't see steelcat tenant she can only
3:28
see users that are in the same tency as
3:32
she is food items there's no way to
3:35
filter and then the menu same kind of
3:38
thing but yeah that's really it that's
3:40
all I have I hope you learned something
3:42
I hope you check out the new plugin um
3:44
if you have any feedback feedback hit me
3:46
up on Discord or Twitter yeah catch you
3:49
