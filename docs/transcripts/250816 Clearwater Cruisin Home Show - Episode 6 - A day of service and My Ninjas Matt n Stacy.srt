1
00:00:01,840 --> 00:00:04,400
All right, good evening everyone. We're

2
00:00:04,400 --> 00:00:05,840
coming at you from

3
00:00:08,320 --> 00:00:10,800
HS Hangout, otherwise known as the Fifth

4
00:00:10,800 --> 00:00:13,640
Element's lair. And this is the

5
00:00:14,080 --> 00:00:16,800
consort to the Fifth Element and the

6
00:00:16,800 --> 00:00:19,680
Fifth Element herself. Anyhow, um

7
00:00:20,880 --> 00:00:23,520
I was going through the day's videos

8
00:00:23,520 --> 00:00:26,240
here, and so I was going to

9
00:00:26,240 --> 00:00:27,840
curate my day.

10
00:00:29,440 --> 00:00:32,081
and I wanted to start with last night as

11
00:00:32,081 --> 00:00:34,641
it were because it's really

12
00:00:34,641 --> 00:00:36,401
cool. So I've got

13
00:00:38,481 --> 00:00:41,041
this up here um

14
00:00:42,921 --> 00:00:45,601
and this was last night I think

15
00:00:45,921 --> 00:00:48,721
and we're going to pull that

16
00:00:48,721 --> 00:00:51,201
up and I'm going to mute my mic here and

17
00:00:51,201 --> 00:00:53,401
then hopefully unmute it once I get to

18
00:00:53,401 --> 00:00:54,801
the end of this here.

19
00:01:04,881 --> 00:01:05,201
Yeah.

20
00:01:26,081 --> 00:01:27,041
Good Daisy.

21
00:03:27,123 --> 00:03:28,083
Good evening.

22
00:03:32,083 --> 00:03:34,803
Hi, buddy. Hi, buddy.

23
00:03:35,363 --> 00:03:36,124
How are you?

24
00:03:41,764 --> 00:03:44,244
Where's Matt?Come on, little buddy.

25
00:03:49,524 --> 00:03:52,364
Come on. Hi, Tom. Hello.

26
00:04:07,764 --> 00:04:08,404
Mika.

27
00:04:10,724 --> 00:04:12,964
Max, come on, little buddy. Max,

28
00:04:13,844 --> 00:04:16,764
this way. Yeah, that's

29
00:04:16,764 --> 00:04:17,924
right. Come on, Granddaddy.

30
00:04:20,964 --> 00:04:21,924
Come on, Grandpa.

31
00:04:29,364 --> 00:04:32,244
Hakuna masala. What a wonderful

32
00:04:32,244 --> 00:04:34,724
face. Look, buddy.

33
00:05:41,366 --> 00:05:43,286
Oh, it feels so good on my feet.

34
00:06:00,166 --> 00:06:02,326
Thank you, God, for this day.

35
00:06:04,246 --> 00:06:06,886
Thank you, Mother God, for this day.

36
00:06:18,846 --> 00:06:21,686
Come on, Granddaddy. Come

37
00:06:21,686 --> 00:06:24,486
on, Grandma. Come on,

38
00:06:24,486 --> 00:06:25,206
Grandmy.

39
00:06:27,446 --> 00:06:29,686
I am actually speaking the truth.

40
00:06:47,927 --> 00:06:50,367
Oh, it's so nice out here. It's perfect

41
00:06:50,367 --> 00:06:52,327
temperature. I'll get Mika water at the

42
00:06:52,327 --> 00:06:55,127
next station. Huh

43
00:06:59,047 --> 00:07:00,407
The temperature is perfect.

44
00:07:07,287 --> 00:07:09,367
There's so many different colors of pink

45
00:07:09,367 --> 00:07:10,647
and blue in the sky.

46
00:07:11,687 --> 00:07:14,487
Okay, Granddaddy wants something

47
00:07:14,567 --> 00:07:15,527
that's different.

48
00:07:19,847 --> 00:07:21,447
All right, Grandpa, I gotcha.

49
00:07:36,087 --> 00:07:37,367
Map. Grandpa.

50
00:08:02,408 --> 00:08:04,608
Good girl. Good

51
00:08:04,608 --> 00:08:07,528
Mika. I love that doggy.

52
00:09:17,089 --> 00:09:18,569
Good evening. Hello. How

53
00:09:22,369 --> 00:09:25,089
are you?We are well. We

54
00:09:25,089 --> 00:09:27,529
love this place. Yeah, so do

55
00:09:31,169 --> 00:09:33,049
we. Three or four times a week we love

56
00:09:33,569 --> 00:09:34,649
this place. Yeah, we try to get here

57
00:09:34,649 --> 00:09:37,569
every day. I'm coming

58
00:09:37,609 --> 00:09:39,289
up from Largo, so it's a little bit of

59
00:09:39,289 --> 00:09:42,049
a... Worth it. Totally. Like the

60
00:09:42,049 --> 00:09:44,009
whole reason to have a car in the first

61
00:09:44,009 --> 00:09:44,329
place. We've

62
00:09:50,690 --> 00:09:53,610
seen you guys here before. I I

63
00:09:53,610 --> 00:09:56,170
oftentimes will post these videos on

64
00:09:56,170 --> 00:09:59,050
YouTube. Oh. And I posted

65
00:09:59,050 --> 00:10:01,730
about 11 or 12 of these dog

66
00:10:01,730 --> 00:10:04,410
park lots of about the 50 that I have. Ohh

67
00:10:05,690 --> 00:10:08,330
And then I have another-- 50

68
00:10:09,370 --> 00:10:11,770
different parks?No. 50 from here. 50

69
00:10:11,770 --> 00:10:14,490
different walks, peaceful walks,

70
00:10:14,650 --> 00:10:17,410
or not so peaceful. But the

71
00:10:17,410 --> 00:10:20,330
main thing is is that I have a channel,

72
00:10:20,330 --> 00:10:21,850
it's called Clearwater Cruising

73
00:10:21,850 --> 00:10:24,410
Ministries, and there is a

74
00:10:24,410 --> 00:10:26,690
playlist on it called Enterprise Dog

75
00:10:26,730 --> 00:10:29,370
Park. which is nothing but

76
00:10:29,370 --> 00:10:31,890
serendipitous dog park interactions with

77
00:10:31,890 --> 00:10:33,490
a whole bunch of wonderful people and

78
00:10:33,490 --> 00:10:35,850
dogs and nature because

79
00:10:35,850 --> 00:10:37,930
oftentimes they're just peaceful, quiet

80
00:10:37,930 --> 00:10:40,890
walks. Were you here last year?I've been

81
00:10:40,890 --> 00:10:41,850
coming here for

82
00:10:44,090 --> 00:10:47,050
seven years. So are you familiar

83
00:10:47,170 --> 00:10:48,531
with the owl nest that was here?Yeah,

84
00:10:48,531 --> 00:10:51,291
vaguely. Do you have a general

85
00:10:51,371 --> 00:10:54,011
idea of where it was?Ohh I just thought

86
00:10:54,011 --> 00:10:56,091
there was an owl up there somewhere, but

87
00:10:56,411 --> 00:10:58,491
I honestly don't know. That's a good one

88
00:10:58,651 --> 00:11:01,131
to... I've been looking like every time I

89
00:11:01,131 --> 00:11:02,891
come up here, because they got

90
00:11:05,771 --> 00:11:08,731
a part in the nest. Normally I try

91
00:11:08,731 --> 00:11:10,971
to respect guests and not like film

92
00:11:10,971 --> 00:11:13,611
people, but I oftentimes film myself. But

93
00:11:13,611 --> 00:11:16,331
no, I have, so I I post these

94
00:11:16,331 --> 00:11:19,291
dog park visits that I do, and

95
00:11:19,291 --> 00:11:21,851
then... I also, in the hopes,

96
00:11:22,011 --> 00:11:24,651
mainly that what it does is like if you

97
00:11:24,651 --> 00:11:26,331
have to leave your dog at home,

98
00:11:27,851 --> 00:11:30,451
then it gives them a dog park experience

99
00:11:30,451 --> 00:11:33,051
while you're gone. And not only that,

100
00:11:33,891 --> 00:11:36,731
but an authentic one. So if you play

101
00:11:36,731 --> 00:11:39,531
the Enterprise Dog Park, and usually I

102
00:11:39,531 --> 00:11:42,491
try to keep my voice calm in the

103
00:11:42,891 --> 00:11:44,291
mirror and... What's the name of the site

104
00:11:44,291 --> 00:11:47,131
again?Well,

105
00:11:47,211 --> 00:11:49,772
it's on YouTube. It's Clearwater

106
00:11:49,852 --> 00:11:51,772
Cruising Ministries.

107
00:11:52,732 --> 00:11:55,412
And we are actually a

108
00:11:55,772 --> 00:11:58,212
Christian ministry. Well, although we

109
00:11:58,212 --> 00:12:00,332
have to get our 4013C and all that other

110
00:12:00,332 --> 00:12:02,452
stuff done. But we will be a Christian

111
00:12:02,452 --> 00:12:05,092
ministry, like legally, actually. And And

112
00:12:05,772 --> 00:12:08,732
mainly just kind of driving our soul van

113
00:12:08,732 --> 00:12:11,532
around and and talking to homeless

114
00:12:11,532 --> 00:12:13,492
people or going to pantries and

115
00:12:13,492 --> 00:12:15,212
volunteering at like Florida Dream

116
00:12:15,212 --> 00:12:17,132
Center. and stuff like that. Very nice.

117
00:12:18,812 --> 00:12:20,812
But connecting people with like,

118
00:12:21,772 --> 00:12:24,252
on the edge resources, essentially.

119
00:12:24,892 --> 00:12:26,492
But, and dogs.

120
00:12:29,212 --> 00:12:31,692
Anyhow, but yeah, and then we also drive

121
00:12:31,692 --> 00:12:33,692
around, and then I have a home show on

122
00:12:33,692 --> 00:12:36,252
it. And I'm building

123
00:12:36,252 --> 00:12:39,132
something I call the Angel OS, where

124
00:12:39,132 --> 00:12:41,212
everybody gets an angel, it's just a

125
00:12:41,212 --> 00:12:43,692
really smart shopping cart. that can

126
00:12:43,692 --> 00:12:46,052
configure itself as a

127
00:12:47,052 --> 00:12:49,292
travel agency website for you. Or it

128
00:12:49,292 --> 00:12:52,013
could be like a personal

129
00:12:52,013 --> 00:12:54,253
consulting site or and it can also

130
00:12:54,253 --> 00:12:56,453
connect you with with voice or whatever

131
00:12:56,453 --> 00:12:58,653
and securely on your own private hardware

132
00:12:58,973 --> 00:13:01,853
so that, okay guys, I guess we're not

133
00:13:01,853 --> 00:13:03,533
going all the way around. We really need

134
00:13:03,533 --> 00:13:06,093
to do a whole circle, but I'm following

135
00:13:06,093 --> 00:13:08,493
Max right now and he he wins.

136
00:13:08,973 --> 00:13:11,893
That's my grandfather by the way. I'm

137
00:13:11,893 --> 00:13:13,853
not lying. He really is my grandfather.

138
00:13:14,173 --> 00:13:16,333
Or he's he is the soul...

139
00:13:17,853 --> 00:13:20,573
No, he is literally actually the soul

140
00:13:20,573 --> 00:13:22,973
energy of my grandfather, Harry B.

141
00:13:22,973 --> 00:13:25,253
Vassey. And tell me that is not the

142
00:13:25,293 --> 00:13:26,413
harriest little...

143
00:13:28,493 --> 00:13:31,453
And And Harry B. Vassey, I might add,

144
00:13:31,453 --> 00:13:34,413
bars. But when you understand this little

145
00:13:34,413 --> 00:13:37,133
guy, and then understand the soul

146
00:13:37,133 --> 00:13:39,053
threads that connect him to my

147
00:13:39,053 --> 00:13:42,013
grandfather,I'm telling you.

148
00:13:42,653 --> 00:13:45,293
And not only that, but my dog

149
00:13:45,293 --> 00:13:48,253
Daisy right there. No

150
00:13:48,253 --> 00:13:50,733
lie. That is Beth

151
00:13:50,893 --> 00:13:53,454
Bassey. I'm not lying to you.

152
00:13:54,014 --> 00:13:56,734
I'm not. My grandparents literally

153
00:13:57,214 --> 00:13:59,774
reincarnated as my dogs. And I'm not

154
00:13:59,774 --> 00:14:02,414
lying to you. And I'm not crazy either.

155
00:14:02,894 --> 00:14:03,334
I just...

156
00:14:05,774 --> 00:14:08,334
This one does because I keep a very good

157
00:14:08,334 --> 00:14:11,134
journal and... As a result of my

158
00:14:11,134 --> 00:14:14,094
very good journal that I keep, I see all

159
00:14:14,094 --> 00:14:15,934
of these synchronicities. No, I'm

160
00:14:15,934 --> 00:14:18,894
serious. So I'm sorry I

161
00:14:18,894 --> 00:14:21,854
didn't mean to mess you up. I found

162
00:14:21,854 --> 00:14:24,814
my dog. Have a

163
00:14:24,814 --> 00:14:25,694
blessed day.

164
00:14:28,174 --> 00:14:29,694
But yes, Christians do believe in

165
00:14:29,694 --> 00:14:32,654
reincarnation. This one does.

166
00:14:36,414 --> 00:14:39,214
And Mother Gaia, and how important Mother

167
00:14:39,214 --> 00:14:41,694
Nature is, and why I walk barefoot in

168
00:14:41,694 --> 00:14:44,574
here to ground myself to Mother Gaia in

169
00:14:44,574 --> 00:14:45,534
particular.

170
00:14:54,035 --> 00:14:55,595
But that's the reason why I walk

171
00:14:55,635 --> 00:14:58,435
barefoot, is to connect

172
00:14:58,435 --> 00:15:00,195
with Mother Gaia. No, it seems to

173
00:15:01,395 --> 00:15:04,115
be purple. Well, this is better and

174
00:15:04,115 --> 00:15:06,035
easier, because it's just shells.

175
00:15:08,615 --> 00:15:10,775
But we get that grounding energy coming

176
00:15:10,775 --> 00:15:12,655
back. You have a blessed evening. I

177
00:15:12,655 --> 00:15:15,375
didn't mean to scare you with the

178
00:15:15,375 --> 00:15:16,975
reincarnation thing.

179
00:15:18,575 --> 00:15:21,055
Have a blessed evening. I'm going to say

180
00:15:21,055 --> 00:15:22,655
goodnight to Mother Gaia here.

181
00:15:23,375 --> 00:15:25,615
Ohh Thank you, Mother Gaia.

182
00:15:38,775 --> 00:15:40,255
And thank you, Father God.

183
00:15:42,095 --> 00:15:44,335
Sorry we did not do a complete lap. It

184
00:15:44,335 --> 00:15:45,615
did get kind of dark.

185
00:15:49,455 --> 00:15:51,375
I kind of scared somebody. I didn't mean

186
00:15:51,375 --> 00:15:54,255
to. I do that. It's

187
00:15:54,255 --> 00:15:55,215
so beautiful.

188
00:16:10,096 --> 00:16:12,656
Oh, thank you God for this day. I'm only

189
00:16:12,656 --> 00:16:13,376
mean well.

190
00:16:33,096 --> 00:16:34,736
What a beautiful evening in

191
00:16:36,416 --> 00:16:39,336
Clearwater, Florida at Enterprise Dog

192
00:16:39,376 --> 00:16:39,776
Park.

193
00:16:42,656 --> 00:16:44,496
Thank you God for this day.

194
00:16:45,456 --> 00:16:45,856
Yeah!

195
00:17:16,627 --> 00:17:19,267
A song about enterprise door parking

196
00:17:19,787 --> 00:17:22,667
Clearwater, Florida Where I'd take

197
00:17:22,667 --> 00:17:25,387
Meeka Daisy and Max to play The

198
00:17:25,387 --> 00:17:28,267
park is vast and when we walk We call

199
00:17:28,267 --> 00:17:31,147
it our circle of life Or a

200
00:17:31,147 --> 00:17:32,267
circle of life

201
00:18:17,218 --> 00:18:20,178
Oh, oh, oh, oh, ohMatata,

202
00:18:20,738 --> 00:18:23,618
good long Matata. Plainwater,

203
00:18:23,698 --> 00:18:26,498
Florida, where I take a

204
00:18:26,498 --> 00:18:29,378
easy and max to play. The park is fast,

205
00:18:29,378 --> 00:18:32,338
and when we walk, we call it our circle

206
00:18:32,338 --> 00:18:34,658
of life, or a circle of

207
00:18:34,658 --> 00:18:35,418
life.

208
00:19:06,819 --> 00:19:09,059
Good morning, everyone. We're at the

209
00:19:09,139 --> 00:19:11,339
Florida Dream Center, which is the

210
00:19:11,539 --> 00:19:13,779
firehouse on

211
00:19:13,779 --> 00:19:16,179
56th Avenue, I think,

212
00:19:17,139 --> 00:19:19,139
in Lillman, Florida.

213
00:19:20,179 --> 00:19:21,939
And I used...

214
00:19:28,019 --> 00:19:29,539
I used to volunteer here

215
00:19:31,379 --> 00:19:34,099
for 300 hours, and not here, but at the

216
00:19:34,099 --> 00:19:36,859
49th Street Pantry. So I'm just kind of

217
00:19:36,859 --> 00:19:39,779
walking around. I love

218
00:19:39,779 --> 00:19:40,539
this place. It's

219
00:19:43,059 --> 00:19:44,659
been a while since I've been back, but I

220
00:19:44,659 --> 00:19:46,979
really need to be back here, of all

221
00:19:46,979 --> 00:19:49,579
places, because of a lot of reasons. And

222
00:19:49,579 --> 00:19:50,979
I honestly don't know what I'm going to

223
00:19:50,979 --> 00:19:53,939
find out. I do know

224
00:19:53,939 --> 00:19:56,619
that I'mhere early and

225
00:19:56,619 --> 00:19:58,659
late at the same time because they have a

226
00:19:58,659 --> 00:20:00,979
whole team inside that's actually getting

227
00:20:00,979 --> 00:20:02,660
all these boxes ready and I don't even

228
00:20:03,140 --> 00:20:04,900
get a box or anything. So let's see what

229
00:20:04,900 --> 00:20:07,540
we find out. Alright, and you can see

230
00:20:07,540 --> 00:20:08,980
they're busy at work behind me.

231
00:20:11,140 --> 00:20:13,580
Let's go ahead and clean the

232
00:20:13,580 --> 00:20:15,900
entire... This used to be a

233
00:20:15,900 --> 00:20:18,260
firehouse and

234
00:20:20,340 --> 00:20:23,220
they have had this for a

235
00:20:23,220 --> 00:20:26,020
long time. Well,for as long as

236
00:20:26,020 --> 00:20:28,420
I've been living in

237
00:20:28,740 --> 00:20:31,620
Pinellas County this thing. And

238
00:20:32,820 --> 00:20:35,540
you can see, very

239
00:20:35,540 --> 00:20:38,420
nice operation. Anyway, we'll be back

240
00:20:38,420 --> 00:20:39,860
in touch momentarily.

241
00:20:48,030 --> 00:20:50,670
All right, so another, a

242
00:20:51,470 --> 00:20:53,470
beautiful morning at the Florida Dream

243
00:20:53,470 --> 00:20:56,070
Center, framing and the truck,

244
00:20:56,270 --> 00:20:58,030
and now we're off to the next stop.

245
00:20:59,100 --> 00:21:00,420
where we're going to go to Leomin

246
00:21:08,821 --> 00:21:11,101
or to United Methodist Church and see

247
00:21:11,101 --> 00:21:12,021
what's going on there. All

248
00:21:16,421 --> 00:21:18,581
right, good morning, Gunters.

249
00:21:19,461 --> 00:21:22,101
We're at Clearview

250
00:21:22,181 --> 00:21:24,421
United Methodist Church down here in

251
00:21:24,421 --> 00:21:26,901
Leomin in in St. Pete area.

252
00:21:28,341 --> 00:21:30,861
And I'm about to go do some traffic

253
00:21:30,861 --> 00:21:33,741
control here, I think. Help out. I just

254
00:21:33,741 --> 00:21:35,621
moved the Soul Van over. I don't know how

255
00:21:35,621 --> 00:21:37,461
the Soul Van's going to be employed or

256
00:21:37,461 --> 00:21:39,781
deployed. Definitely not going to be

257
00:21:39,781 --> 00:21:42,541
deployed today. But we are

258
00:21:43,941 --> 00:21:46,901
definitely really psyched about

259
00:21:47,781 --> 00:21:50,741
putting on our black hat that

260
00:21:50,741 --> 00:21:52,981
says Norminal so that we don't get a

261
00:21:52,981 --> 00:21:53,541
sunburn.

262
00:21:56,101 --> 00:21:58,901
Uh We do haveOur

263
00:21:58,981 --> 00:22:01,621
normal, normal hat.

264
00:22:03,461 --> 00:22:05,221
And I should have worn my Dream Center.

265
00:22:06,822 --> 00:22:09,302
Thank you, Angry Everyday Astronaut. Not

266
00:22:09,302 --> 00:22:11,062
Everyday Astronaut. Yeah,

267
00:22:11,782 --> 00:22:14,742
Angry. I watch Angry and I watch Everyday

268
00:22:14,742 --> 00:22:16,662
Astronaut. So,

269
00:22:17,862 --> 00:22:20,742
right now, coming up on

270
00:22:20,782 --> 00:22:20,902
this

271
00:22:24,182 --> 00:22:27,022
big tent here. Boy, this big cupboard

272
00:22:27,182 --> 00:22:29,262
here. Let's see how this is. A lot of

273
00:22:29,262 --> 00:22:31,222
people don't like to be recorded, so I'm

274
00:22:31,222 --> 00:22:34,182
going to turn it off respectfully at a

275
00:22:34,182 --> 00:22:36,262
distance here and see what's going on.

276
00:22:36,262 --> 00:22:36,902
Alright guys.

277
00:22:40,902 --> 00:22:43,062
Hi guys, I'm with?Cisco.

278
00:22:43,462 --> 00:22:46,102
Cisco with the Florida Dream Center, and

279
00:22:46,102 --> 00:22:48,102
Colette already put me to work guiding

280
00:22:48,102 --> 00:22:49,742
traffic, so I'm going to guide traffic

281
00:22:49,742 --> 00:22:51,542
down here, but it's really filled up down

282
00:22:51,542 --> 00:22:53,262
there, so we're going to have to move

283
00:22:53,262 --> 00:22:55,782
them around up here. Cisco. Yes.

284
00:22:56,422 --> 00:22:57,542
Alright, anyway.

285
00:23:00,182 --> 00:23:02,582
So also, revenge on you. All

286
00:23:03,302 --> 00:23:04,102
right. Thanks for watching.

287
00:23:13,893 --> 00:23:14,413
Don't get

288
00:23:20,133 --> 00:23:21,933
duped by eating the raw. Okay, real

289
00:23:21,933 --> 00:23:24,533
quick, who we're about to see, his name

290
00:23:24,533 --> 00:23:27,093
is Gary, I forget his last name, but

291
00:23:27,853 --> 00:23:30,293
when I first got out of prison,

292
00:23:30,863 --> 00:23:33,303
He was the guy that

293
00:23:34,423 --> 00:23:37,063
had lights for me for my

294
00:23:37,063 --> 00:23:39,303
bike because I was I literally

295
00:23:39,303 --> 00:23:42,263
had $90 when my brother left me where he

296
00:23:42,263 --> 00:23:44,743
left me. And so I was

297
00:23:44,743 --> 00:23:47,023
totally broke and I had to go out and

298
00:23:47,023 --> 00:23:49,623
actually earn money in order to survive

299
00:23:49,623 --> 00:23:52,263
in where I was. Anyway, long story short,

300
00:23:53,463 --> 00:23:55,543
one dude gave me a bicycle.

301
00:23:56,383 --> 00:23:58,783
And it was like a yellow mountain bike,

302
00:23:58,783 --> 00:24:00,663
which was too small, but fortunately I

303
00:24:00,663 --> 00:24:03,583
was only 217 pounds at the time, and

304
00:24:03,583 --> 00:24:06,423
so I didn't kill it. And then I only

305
00:24:06,423 --> 00:24:08,904
had to ride eight miles each way to and

306
00:24:08,904 --> 00:24:11,784
from work each day. But I didn't have

307
00:24:11,784 --> 00:24:13,264
lights for the bike, and I couldn't

308
00:24:13,264 --> 00:24:15,904
afford the $14 for the lights at Walmart.

309
00:24:16,584 --> 00:24:19,344
As it happened, I was working at the 49th

310
00:24:19,344 --> 00:24:21,304
Street Pantry, where I had to do

311
00:24:21,304 --> 00:24:23,224
community service, thank God.

312
00:24:24,104 --> 00:24:26,744
And that 49th Street Pantry was an

313
00:24:26,744 --> 00:24:28,824
operation of Florida Dream Center and

314
00:24:28,824 --> 00:24:31,704
Adopt-a-Block, which is a charity which

315
00:24:31,704 --> 00:24:34,344
works out of Leelman, and it

316
00:24:34,344 --> 00:24:36,984
helps all sorts of people in Leelman

317
00:24:36,984 --> 00:24:39,704
area in particular. They work elsewhere,

318
00:24:40,344 --> 00:24:42,624
but okay, hold on one second. Yeah,

319
00:24:42,984 --> 00:24:45,864
okay. Well, I'm talking on this

320
00:24:45,864 --> 00:24:48,504
real quick. So anyhow, that's

321
00:24:48,504 --> 00:24:50,664
Florida Dream Center, and so, and then of

322
00:24:50,664 --> 00:24:52,904
course there's Cindy Herbert who is like,

323
00:24:54,504 --> 00:24:56,904
fairy godmother to so many people

324
00:24:57,464 --> 00:25:00,424
and she just is like Mrs. Santa

325
00:25:00,424 --> 00:25:02,904
Claus, if you will, every Saturday

326
00:25:02,904 --> 00:25:05,304
morning, driving around all over the

327
00:25:05,304 --> 00:25:07,544
place, crazy as all get out. Actually,

328
00:25:07,544 --> 00:25:09,984
no, she respects all the driving loss and

329
00:25:09,984 --> 00:25:12,705
stuff. But like more than anything, she

330
00:25:12,705 --> 00:25:14,825
probably is more, well, there were two

331
00:25:14,825 --> 00:25:17,785
things that inspired the Soul van. A, a

332
00:25:17,785 --> 00:25:20,385
portable executive office suite.

333
00:25:21,185 --> 00:25:23,865
that you can sleep in in a pinch that has

334
00:25:23,865 --> 00:25:26,305
really nice amenities and it was really

335
00:25:26,305 --> 00:25:28,825
inexpensive. But also because it's a

336
00:25:28,825 --> 00:25:30,945
great ministry vehicle and it allows you

337
00:25:30,945 --> 00:25:33,385
to go around and take the dogs and a

338
00:25:33,385 --> 00:25:36,105
med's dogs and a med's girlfriend or

339
00:25:36,105 --> 00:25:38,705
whomever, but we can all be comfortable

340
00:25:38,705 --> 00:25:40,785
in the soul van and align our spirits

341
00:25:40,785 --> 00:25:42,265
together and listen to some really

342
00:25:42,265 --> 00:25:44,545
awesome music. So anyway, back to the

343
00:25:44,545 --> 00:25:47,505
show. This is Gary, and I can't remember

344
00:25:47,505 --> 00:25:50,345
his last name, but he's been

345
00:25:50,345 --> 00:25:52,305
with the ministry with, well, with

346
00:25:52,305 --> 00:25:54,905
Florida Dream Center for all this time, I

347
00:25:54,905 --> 00:25:57,625
guess, and thank God because the guy is

348
00:25:57,625 --> 00:26:00,385
just, he's definitely a guardian angel,

349
00:26:00,385 --> 00:26:03,145
and he is and was my

350
00:26:03,145 --> 00:26:06,025
guardian angel when I needed somebody,

351
00:26:06,025 --> 00:26:08,105
he was there for me, and it was in the

352
00:26:08,105 --> 00:26:10,665
most perfect way, in the most perfect

353
00:26:10,665 --> 00:26:12,146
way. So let's listen to what he has to

354
00:26:12,186 --> 00:26:12,506
say.

355
00:26:22,346 --> 00:26:25,146
well Is there a festival coming

356
00:26:25,546 --> 00:26:28,346
up?The women's events committee

357
00:26:28,906 --> 00:26:31,826
that puts on the Christmas tree lighting

358
00:26:31,826 --> 00:26:33,946
and the 4th of July event. We've got

359
00:26:34,746 --> 00:26:37,626
an event in in autumn and fall this year.

360
00:26:38,306 --> 00:26:41,066
The Harvest Festival, October 25th, and I

361
00:26:41,066 --> 00:26:42,586
know that's a long way off, but if you

362
00:26:42,666 --> 00:26:44,386
have any questions about the Harvest

363
00:26:44,386 --> 00:26:45,586
Festival coming up, we'll be talking a

364
00:26:45,586 --> 00:26:48,026
little about it, but those two can tell

365
00:26:48,106 --> 00:26:49,226
you all about it.

366
00:26:53,386 --> 00:26:55,346
That's going to be an evening event, and

367
00:26:55,346 --> 00:26:56,546
that's going to be a lot of fun. That

368
00:26:56,546 --> 00:26:58,466
starts, I think, at 5 o'clock. We'll go

369
00:26:58,506 --> 00:26:59,146
talk to them back up.

370
00:27:01,386 --> 00:27:04,186
I think that's all of the all the

371
00:27:04,186 --> 00:27:06,506
announcements that I have. I do want to

372
00:27:06,746 --> 00:27:08,506
share a scripture with you because I'd

373
00:27:08,506 --> 00:27:09,466
like to do that.

374
00:27:11,826 --> 00:27:14,707
3 says, By His divine power, God has

375
00:27:14,707 --> 00:27:16,987
given us everything we need for living a

376
00:27:16,987 --> 00:27:19,947
godly life. We have received all of this

377
00:27:19,947 --> 00:27:21,707
by coming to know Him, the one who's

378
00:27:21,707 --> 00:27:23,547
called us to Himself by means of His

379
00:27:23,547 --> 00:27:25,947
modesty, glory, and excellence.

380
00:27:26,787 --> 00:27:28,787
And I know there's times when I'm going

381
00:27:28,787 --> 00:27:30,427
through trials and going through

382
00:27:30,787 --> 00:27:32,507
challenges, got things in front of me

383
00:27:32,507 --> 00:27:34,187
that I just don't think I have what it

384
00:27:34,187 --> 00:27:36,107
takes to get through, or I don't think

385
00:27:36,947 --> 00:27:39,227
I'm native enough or I'm sufficient

386
00:27:39,227 --> 00:27:42,027
enough, and this isThis is

387
00:27:42,027 --> 00:27:44,427
helpful to remember that that God has

388
00:27:44,427 --> 00:27:46,987
given us everything, everything we need

389
00:27:46,987 --> 00:27:49,067
to get to get through that. I hope that

390
00:27:49,067 --> 00:27:50,027
can encourage you today.

391
00:27:52,027 --> 00:27:54,667
Father, we just thank you for for your

392
00:27:54,667 --> 00:27:56,827
words, a reminder today that that you

393
00:27:56,947 --> 00:27:59,747
equip us with everything, everything that

394
00:27:59,747 --> 00:28:02,347
we need to get through. And you are all

395
00:28:02,467 --> 00:28:05,387
provided. We just thank you

396
00:28:05,387 --> 00:28:08,027
for that. We just ask you to protect our

397
00:28:08,027 --> 00:28:10,667
teens as they go out today, Father. We

398
00:28:10,667 --> 00:28:13,387
just ask toare hungry, find one of our

399
00:28:13,547 --> 00:28:16,068
Bottom of Life quotations, one of our

400
00:28:16,068 --> 00:28:18,588
staff members, and just protect as they

401
00:28:18,588 --> 00:28:20,748
go. And just thank you for your

402
00:28:20,748 --> 00:28:22,268
permission. We'd love you to thank you.

403
00:28:22,268 --> 00:28:22,588
Amen.

404
00:28:30,108 --> 00:28:30,668
Hi, Gary.

405
00:28:35,948 --> 00:28:37,948
That's Cindy driving the truck.

406
00:29:09,198 --> 00:29:11,918
That is a cool van. You

407
00:29:11,918 --> 00:29:12,798
know it's comfortable.

408
00:29:15,678 --> 00:29:18,239
This is an awesome Savannah set up for

409
00:29:18,239 --> 00:29:20,999
like ultimate living and

410
00:29:22,399 --> 00:29:24,959
wow, this is

411
00:29:24,959 --> 00:29:25,679
awesome.

412
00:29:29,069 --> 00:29:30,669
It's beautiful and it looks comfortable

413
00:29:30,669 --> 00:29:33,589
as all get out too. And you

414
00:29:33,589 --> 00:29:35,709
have the overhead, which makes it a huge

415
00:29:35,709 --> 00:29:37,469
difference. I miss not having that

416
00:29:37,469 --> 00:29:40,269
actually. Yeah, I had, I

417
00:29:40,269 --> 00:29:42,429
was about to buy one of these Explorers.

418
00:29:42,429 --> 00:29:44,669
I'm gonna, they, they can find it.

419
00:29:44,669 --> 00:29:47,549
There's one more spot right up there. I

420
00:29:47,549 --> 00:29:50,109
was very close to buying an Explorer for

421
00:29:50,189 --> 00:29:52,909
8,900. And the

422
00:29:53,069 --> 00:29:55,469
deal fell through. I'm glad. That one was

423
00:29:55,469 --> 00:29:57,589
only 45. But

424
00:29:58,989 --> 00:30:00,429
I love what you've done. And you have a

425
00:30:00,509 --> 00:30:01,709
portable AC in here?

426
00:30:03,949 --> 00:30:05,389
I'm going to have to help this person

427
00:30:05,389 --> 00:30:07,069
find a spot real quick. I'll be right

428
00:30:07,069 --> 00:30:08,429
back. I'm scared.

429
00:30:12,029 --> 00:30:12,349
And a half

430
00:30:15,069 --> 00:30:16,509
hours of AC on battery.

431
00:30:19,230 --> 00:30:21,990
Wow, that looks really cool. like you see

432
00:30:21,990 --> 00:30:24,470
what I got, I got over here,

433
00:30:25,830 --> 00:30:27,390
and we're not gonna do it. And this is

434
00:30:27,630 --> 00:30:29,710
this is fantastic what I did over here, I

435
00:30:29,710 --> 00:30:32,350
can show you on the back. And I saw on my

436
00:30:32,350 --> 00:30:34,830
other van, they cut out a hole right here

437
00:30:35,470 --> 00:30:36,590
for the AC. Look

438
00:30:38,470 --> 00:30:40,110
at this, when I rent this air condition,

439
00:30:40,590 --> 00:30:41,950
I'm gonna have to help this person. In

440
00:30:41,950 --> 00:30:44,350
the winter time, I just open this,

441
00:30:45,310 --> 00:30:47,510
put a piece of plastic over here, and I

442
00:30:47,510 --> 00:30:50,190
have a heat and AC. And what kind of

443
00:30:50,190 --> 00:30:52,910
unit is this?This is just regular air

444
00:30:52,910 --> 00:30:55,710
condition, $200. But But the amazing

445
00:30:55,710 --> 00:30:56,950
thing what I what i did... What

446
00:31:01,550 --> 00:31:04,510
I did over here... You see,

447
00:31:05,230 --> 00:31:08,190
I built... I built the thermostat

448
00:31:08,430 --> 00:31:10,750
right over there, next to the blue cage.

449
00:31:10,910 --> 00:31:13,470
Right. So when the temperature go

450
00:31:13,470 --> 00:31:16,430
down, it go up, the

451
00:31:16,430 --> 00:31:17,950
engine go like this.

452
00:31:23,711 --> 00:31:26,631
Hold on a second. Let me help

453
00:31:26,631 --> 00:31:28,911
this guy. Okay, they got a spot. Okay,

454
00:31:28,911 --> 00:31:30,351
that's good. I don't want to get in

455
00:31:30,351 --> 00:31:31,551
trouble for not helping. You see?

456
00:31:33,271 --> 00:31:35,431
No, the engine start. When the

457
00:31:35,431 --> 00:31:38,031
temperature go down like, like

458
00:31:40,031 --> 00:31:42,351
it... And it is like .5 gallons per hour,

459
00:31:42,591 --> 00:31:45,231
.25 gallons per hour on your engine?I

460
00:31:45,311 --> 00:31:48,111
have 4.3. No, I just meant, what do you

461
00:31:48,111 --> 00:31:50,431
think like your gallons per hour is on an

462
00:31:50,431 --> 00:31:52,831
idling engine?Well,

463
00:31:56,751 --> 00:31:59,351
in in two hours, gallon

464
00:32:01,791 --> 00:32:04,591
and a half. Okay. Two

465
00:32:05,231 --> 00:32:08,031
hours. It's a lot of storage room. This

466
00:32:08,031 --> 00:32:09,951
is awesome. Thank you so much for sharing

467
00:32:09,951 --> 00:32:10,151
this.

468
00:32:27,952 --> 00:32:29,472
All right, well, it's about...

469
00:32:33,712 --> 00:32:36,072
46 and the

470
00:32:36,272 --> 00:32:39,072
Colette put me on parking

471
00:32:39,072 --> 00:32:41,792
duty, so I'm helping out with parking and

472
00:32:41,952 --> 00:32:43,072
and just making sure that

473
00:32:44,992 --> 00:32:47,072
People move to the front here. We got one

474
00:32:47,312 --> 00:32:48,192
open space.

475
00:32:50,032 --> 00:32:52,992
But anyway, just enjoying

476
00:32:52,992 --> 00:32:54,712
the morning and all the interesting

477
00:32:54,712 --> 00:32:56,112
people coming through here. It's really

478
00:32:56,112 --> 00:32:58,112
nice to be back or whatever.

479
00:32:59,672 --> 00:33:01,552
I just had to take things one day at a

480
00:33:01,552 --> 00:33:04,512
time, and but I love this place. Anyway.

481
00:33:18,752 --> 00:33:19,952
Oh, this is so

482
00:33:35,083 --> 00:33:37,913
cool. She starts looking around at these

483
00:33:38,033 --> 00:33:39,313
friends of hers that got her here

484
00:33:39,473 --> 00:33:40,673
somewhere. They wouldn't have just

485
00:33:40,673 --> 00:33:42,193
abandoned her. They were so nice. How

486
00:33:42,233 --> 00:33:43,633
could this possibly be?And she's looking

487
00:33:44,913 --> 00:33:45,993
around and all she can see is just

488
00:33:46,273 --> 00:33:47,993
darkness. And there's some moonlight

489
00:33:47,993 --> 00:33:49,633
coming through the rear end over the

490
00:33:49,633 --> 00:33:51,313
pond. But when she looked into the tree

491
00:33:51,313 --> 00:33:53,153
line, it was just-- Can you pause it for

492
00:33:53,153 --> 00:33:55,633
a second?All she can hear is birds and

493
00:33:55,633 --> 00:33:57,473
insects, you know, night sounds. And

494
00:33:57,473 --> 00:33:57,953
remember,

495
00:34:10,353 --> 00:34:10,913
Now go over.

496
00:34:19,473 --> 00:34:22,073
Buddy, buddy, buddy,

497
00:34:22,113 --> 00:34:24,233
buddy. He's like not in your life.

498
00:34:49,554 --> 00:34:51,474
Just itch him. He's like I do.

499
00:34:53,354 --> 00:34:54,794
Yeah, I like that. Good Daisy. He's okay.

500
00:34:54,794 --> 00:34:57,394
He's not gonna like it. That is

501
00:34:57,474 --> 00:34:59,594
not somebody who would ever find herself

502
00:34:59,714 --> 00:35:02,554
in this position. This is so far out of

503
00:35:02,554 --> 00:35:05,074
her comfort zone, alone at night in this

504
00:35:05,114 --> 00:35:07,314
forest, in this austere environment.

505
00:35:07,314 --> 00:35:09,154
Suddenly it felt very austere and

506
00:35:09,554 --> 00:35:11,874
terrified. And at the same time, her mind

507
00:35:11,874 --> 00:35:13,994
starts telling her, oh my gosh, this

508
00:35:13,994 --> 00:35:16,274
whole thing was a trap. Those five people

509
00:35:18,994 --> 00:35:20,994
were . And so she's thinking, oh, I'm in

510
00:35:20,994 --> 00:35:23,194
danger. I have to get out of here. And

511
00:35:23,194 --> 00:35:25,074
she turns, and she looks at the trail

512
00:35:25,194 --> 00:35:26,675
that brought them up here, and all she

513
00:35:26,675 --> 00:35:28,315
sees is just this dark

514
00:35:29,475 --> 00:35:30,915
cut path through the trees that's

515
00:35:30,915 --> 00:35:33,635
basically pitching. And she says, I have

516
00:35:33,635 --> 00:35:36,115
to walk through that alone in the middle

517
00:35:36,115 --> 00:35:37,635
of the night. She didn't have a light or

518
00:35:37,795 --> 00:35:39,635
or anything that would help guide her way

519
00:35:39,635 --> 00:35:41,795
out of you. But as she's sitting there

520
00:35:41,795 --> 00:35:43,795
panicking, she's thinking, I have to go

521
00:35:43,875 --> 00:35:45,955
right now, like it's life or death. And

522
00:35:46,275 --> 00:35:48,075
so she stands up and immediately she

523
00:35:48,115 --> 00:35:49,915
feels really weak on her feet. She's

524
00:35:50,035 --> 00:35:51,955
super fatigued still, but it's like

525
00:35:51,955 --> 00:35:53,755
adrenaline is coursing through her body.

526
00:35:53,755 --> 00:35:55,475
She's gotta get out of here. We love you,

527
00:35:55,475 --> 00:35:58,275
Harry Bassey. We love you, Granddaddy.

528
00:35:58,435 --> 00:36:00,915
I love you,

529
00:36:00,915 --> 00:36:03,715
Grammy. I'm leaning on

530
00:36:03,715 --> 00:36:06,515
Grammy right now, it's Daisy. She keeps

531
00:36:06,515 --> 00:36:08,915
hearing noises all around her. We love

532
00:36:08,915 --> 00:36:11,155
you, Grammy. Coming back to hurt her, or

533
00:36:11,635 --> 00:36:12,995
animals, or she doesn't know what. I

534
00:36:13,395 --> 00:36:15,715
mean, she's in full panic club here, but

535
00:36:15,715 --> 00:36:17,915
just for hours, or what felt like hours,

536
00:36:17,915 --> 00:36:20,115
she just stumbled through these trails,

537
00:36:20,195 --> 00:36:22,115
you know, getting completely disoriented,

538
00:36:22,155 --> 00:36:24,515
and finally she comes to the scream, and

539
00:36:24,515 --> 00:36:26,595
she just stops, and she's sitting there

540
00:36:26,595 --> 00:36:28,356
and she realizes, you know, the sun is

541
00:36:28,356 --> 00:36:30,356
starting to come up. So she kneels down

542
00:36:30,516 --> 00:36:32,476
and she scoops some water into her mouth

543
00:36:32,796 --> 00:36:34,356
and right as the sun comes up across the

544
00:36:34,356 --> 00:36:36,796
mountainside, there's enough light. What

545
00:36:36,796 --> 00:36:39,156
are you doing?Hey, hey,

546
00:36:40,356 --> 00:36:42,996
heyOhh I'm

547
00:36:42,996 --> 00:36:45,076
sorry, Grande. Like

548
00:36:45,796 --> 00:36:47,716
she's going to get out of here unscathed,

549
00:36:47,836 --> 00:36:49,676
presumably. So she kind of catches her

550
00:36:49,676 --> 00:36:51,076
breath. She puts another step from the

551
00:36:51,076 --> 00:36:52,516
stream and then with the help of the

552
00:36:52,516 --> 00:36:54,916
sunlight, she navigates her way to this

553
00:36:54,996 --> 00:36:57,396
trail that she can see. Down the mountain

554
00:36:57,396 --> 00:36:59,316
she went. As she was going down

555
00:37:00,276 --> 00:37:02,436
she looked down towards her village and

556
00:37:02,436 --> 00:37:04,956
she saw clearly there was a big group of

557
00:37:04,956 --> 00:37:07,076
people, presumably villagers out looking

558
00:37:07,956 --> 00:37:09,916
right down on the trail, sort of like

559
00:37:11,556 --> 00:37:13,316
at the beginning of the trail. I love my

560
00:37:13,316 --> 00:37:16,196
bud. I love you too,

561
00:37:16,196 --> 00:37:18,476
Daisy. From the distance, I couldn't

562
00:37:18,476 --> 00:37:19,876
really tell what she was or what she was

563
00:37:19,876 --> 00:37:21,756
doing, but there was some level of

564
00:37:21,756 --> 00:37:23,756
recognition, but she couldn't really tell

565
00:37:23,756 --> 00:37:25,516
what the reaction of the crowd was, but

566
00:37:25,636 --> 00:37:27,956
she had gotten their attentionFaye's so

567
00:37:27,956 --> 00:37:29,796
excited, and down the hill she goes.

568
00:37:30,037 --> 00:37:32,197
Suddenly she feels totally rejuvenated

569
00:37:32,197 --> 00:37:33,797
because she's going to be okay, and she

570
00:37:33,797 --> 00:37:35,837
gets closer to this big crowd of people

571
00:37:35,957 --> 00:37:37,757
that she sees now. It's friends, it's

572
00:37:37,757 --> 00:37:40,517
family, it's definitely her people. The

573
00:37:40,517 --> 00:37:42,797
looks on their faces are not the looks

574
00:37:42,797 --> 00:37:44,877
that Faye had expected. I mean, she did

575
00:37:44,877 --> 00:37:47,037
understand that clearly I've been out

576
00:37:47,077 --> 00:37:48,917
here at least for several hours. They

577
00:37:48,917 --> 00:37:50,677
must have organized a search party,

578
00:37:50,677 --> 00:37:52,277
they've been worried about me, but here I

579
00:37:52,277 --> 00:37:54,997
am. like they gotta be relieved now

580
00:37:55,237 --> 00:37:57,637
right they found I love this little buddy

581
00:37:57,637 --> 00:37:58,117
not really sure

582
00:38:01,397 --> 00:38:03,637
what to make a fake coming down the

583
00:38:03,637 --> 00:38:05,277
mountain side it's just hard it like he's

584
00:38:05,597 --> 00:38:07,397
just like a puppy and anybody else that

585
00:38:07,397 --> 00:38:09,677
even thinks he's a puppy but like he's an

586
00:38:09,677 --> 00:38:12,117
old man yeah I know man like look at him

587
00:38:12,357 --> 00:38:12,757
he's not gonna

588
00:38:15,317 --> 00:38:17,637
get any bigger he's not gonna you know he

589
00:38:17,637 --> 00:38:18,997
has so much personality

590
00:38:20,037 --> 00:38:21,477
walnuts on his brain

591
00:38:23,277 --> 00:38:25,637
He's a multi-dimensional, yeah, but he's

592
00:38:25,637 --> 00:38:26,597
a multi-dimensional........

593
00:38:32,158 --> 00:38:34,438
They are special,

594
00:38:35,478 --> 00:38:36,838
different people that have

595
00:38:39,318 --> 00:38:40,478
you know, kind of made our way into the

596
00:38:40,478 --> 00:38:41,758
mountains. I don't know, I shouldn't have

597
00:38:41,758 --> 00:38:43,998
done it, but I fell asleep and you know,

598
00:38:43,998 --> 00:38:45,998
here I am. I'm so sorry if I scared you,

599
00:38:45,998 --> 00:38:47,958
you know, but I really, I'm okay. But

600
00:38:47,958 --> 00:38:50,038
Faye's sister, it's like she was hearing

601
00:38:50,038 --> 00:38:51,918
what Faye was saying, but couldn't

602
00:38:51,918 --> 00:38:54,278
process it. We'll go to the store and get

603
00:38:54,278 --> 00:38:55,038
some more, I know. Is

604
00:38:57,918 --> 00:38:59,718
that feeling your arm?That has got to

605
00:38:59,718 --> 00:39:02,518
hurt you, doesn't it?Yeah,

606
00:39:02,758 --> 00:39:05,478
he has one right here, too. That's

607
00:39:05,958 --> 00:39:07,918
not good. What is that?Appreciate that

608
00:39:08,038 --> 00:39:10,718
Faye apparently... ...he has a problem

609
00:39:10,718 --> 00:39:13,558
with him. Faye was crushed in the

610
00:39:13,598 --> 00:39:15,598
water. I go get it out. Can I get that

611
00:39:15,598 --> 00:39:18,198
out for you?60 pounds. She was horribly

612
00:39:18,278 --> 00:39:20,438
malnourished, dehydrated. I mean, they

613
00:39:20,438 --> 00:39:22,158
didn't understand how she was still

614
00:39:22,158 --> 00:39:24,318
alive. And while Faye is being treated,

615
00:39:24,958 --> 00:39:27,518
she did hear like what had happened over

616
00:39:27,558 --> 00:39:30,158
the past... Oh, yeah. I'd say all right,

617
00:39:30,158 --> 00:39:31,718
and he's like, Oh, yeah, all right. All

618
00:39:31,718 --> 00:39:34,639
rightYeah. That showed when they went

619
00:39:34,639 --> 00:39:36,479
into the woods, because she had on that

620
00:39:36,479 --> 00:39:39,399
bright red-- Oh, they caught her walking

621
00:39:39,399 --> 00:39:41,639
into the forest. There you go. Daisy,

622
00:39:41,719 --> 00:39:43,479
good girl. I'm sorry.

623
00:39:44,519 --> 00:39:46,039
Daisy.

624
00:39:49,919 --> 00:39:52,679
Daisy, good girl. We love her

625
00:39:52,679 --> 00:39:55,239
too, but Max is just so cute, you

626
00:39:55,239 --> 00:39:58,039
know?And you know it, because he's,

627
00:39:58,359 --> 00:40:00,199
well, Harry Bassey, Beth.

628
00:40:01,759 --> 00:40:03,919
like Literally, actually. They had not

629
00:40:04,039 --> 00:40:05,599
gone into any of the surrounding

630
00:40:05,599 --> 00:40:07,879
villages, so she had to be

631
00:40:08,359 --> 00:40:10,919
in the 18 Ponds of the Dragon Tank, that

632
00:40:10,919 --> 00:40:12,839
seven and a half mile stretch. But

633
00:40:12,839 --> 00:40:15,079
despite launching a huge search party

634
00:40:15,239 --> 00:40:17,279
into that seven and a half mile stretch

635
00:40:17,279 --> 00:40:19,519
to look for her, and also firing off

636
00:40:19,639 --> 00:40:21,639
fireworks left and right to try to get

637
00:40:21,639 --> 00:40:24,279
her attention, not only did nobody find

638
00:40:24,439 --> 00:40:25,079
any of her...

639
00:40:28,199 --> 00:40:30,479
We love you, buddy. We never heard or saw

640
00:40:30,479 --> 00:40:32,879
any researchers. From her perspective, it

641
00:40:32,959 --> 00:40:34,439
literally felt like she had just fallen

642
00:40:34,599 --> 00:40:37,080
asleep for a few hours and woken up, and

643
00:40:37,080 --> 00:40:39,480
here she was, not 17 days. But

644
00:40:39,480 --> 00:40:41,480
eventually, they would actually go into

645
00:40:41,480 --> 00:40:43,800
detail about the specifics of what she

646
00:40:43,800 --> 00:40:45,960
remembered about this ordeal.

647
00:40:46,560 --> 00:40:48,840
Mainly, she would talk about those five

648
00:40:48,920 --> 00:40:50,1000
people, her new friends, who sort of

649
00:40:50,1000 --> 00:40:53,240
encouraged her to go up into the 18

650
00:40:53,240 --> 00:40:54,720
haunts of the Dragon King, and she

651
00:40:54,720 --> 00:40:56,440
remembered their names, what it looked

652
00:40:56,440 --> 00:40:58,240
like, she remembered discussions she had

653
00:40:58,280 --> 00:41:00,040
with them, and she painted them as

654
00:41:00,200 --> 00:41:02,320
wonderful people, butIt's like she just

655
00:41:02,320 --> 00:41:04,040
woke up and they were gone. So she

656
00:41:04,240 --> 00:41:05,400
thought, you know, maybe they had tricked

657
00:41:05,400 --> 00:41:07,000
her, or you know, maybe they drugged her.

658
00:41:07,560 --> 00:41:08,680
That's why she can't remember this stuff.

659
00:41:09,040 --> 00:41:10,920
Or she didn't know what, but she couldn't

660
00:41:10,920 --> 00:41:12,520
reconcile the fact that they seemed like

661
00:41:12,640 --> 00:41:14,760
such nice people. Such a nice day

662
00:41:14,880 --> 00:41:17,720
outside. It's just hotter than

663
00:41:19,680 --> 00:41:21,880
Arizona right now. It's only like 94

664
00:41:21,880 --> 00:41:24,200
degrees. Look, I see a bugger here.

665
00:41:27,560 --> 00:41:29,880
I'm gonna get that attitude. It's just in

666
00:41:29,880 --> 00:41:32,120
myThey've been dead for

667
00:41:33,720 --> 00:41:35,400
a long time. And we are going out

668
00:41:35,400 --> 00:41:37,801
shortly. They reviewed the security

669
00:41:37,801 --> 00:41:40,121
footage which showed Fay clearly in her

670
00:41:40,441 --> 00:41:42,921
bright red, distinctive coat walking up

671
00:41:42,921 --> 00:41:45,401
the trail into the 18 pawns. There was

672
00:41:45,401 --> 00:41:47,401
nobody else there. Those five people,

673
00:41:47,601 --> 00:41:50,081
they're not on camera. So the 18 pawns of

674
00:41:50,081 --> 00:41:52,841
the Mack and Faye is not justbeautiful

675
00:41:52,841 --> 00:41:54,601
hiking destinations. It's also

676
00:41:57,001 --> 00:41:59,321
made to look at the mountainside, but the

677
00:41:59,361 --> 00:42:01,161
trail pass through and then ups the

678
00:42:01,241 --> 00:42:03,641
forest as well. They sometimes see these

679
00:42:03,801 --> 00:42:06,361
eerie blue lights moving around the tree.

680
00:42:06,521 --> 00:42:09,081
There's a story that, you know,

681
00:42:09,081 --> 00:42:11,481
people that have died, their spirits sort

682
00:42:11,481 --> 00:42:14,241
of haunt this area looking for really

683
00:42:14,281 --> 00:42:16,401
people to switch places with. In fact,

684
00:42:16,481 --> 00:42:18,161
when Faye began coming down the

685
00:42:18,161 --> 00:42:20,161
mountainside and she looked and saw that

686
00:42:20,281 --> 00:42:23,241
hugewas basically, you know, a

687
00:42:23,321 --> 00:42:25,641
search party out to vote for her. Well,

688
00:42:25,721 --> 00:42:28,521
in reality, that wasn't the case. One of

689
00:42:28,521 --> 00:42:31,081
the moguls had looked up and seen what he

690
00:42:31,241 --> 00:42:32,601
thought was another one of those lights.

691
00:42:35,721 --> 00:42:37,521
Oh, he's so cute.

692
00:42:40,202 --> 00:42:42,602
Strange lights, a ghost, let's say. Okay,

693
00:42:42,922 --> 00:42:45,082
I'm so sorry. Everybody was really

694
00:42:45,322 --> 00:42:47,642
excited and it ran out to go see what it

695
00:42:47,642 --> 00:42:49,442
was. It sort of was a ghost. It was a

696
00:42:49,442 --> 00:42:51,482
fame. It had been gone for 17 days,

697
00:42:51,482 --> 00:42:53,682
coming downAnd nobody could believe it.

698
00:42:53,682 --> 00:42:56,042
They were so shocked. And so to this day,

699
00:42:56,322 --> 00:42:58,002
nobody knows what actually happened to

700
00:42:58,002 --> 00:43:00,922
Ben. All we know is we have it on camera

701
00:43:01,042 --> 00:43:02,842
disappearing into this trail, into this

702
00:43:02,842 --> 00:43:05,242
forest, into the mountainside. Righty.

703
00:43:05,482 --> 00:43:08,442
Keep in mind, before

704
00:43:08,442 --> 00:43:10,522
this, the longest anybody had survived

705
00:43:10,522 --> 00:43:12,922
out there after getting lost was 12 days.

706
00:43:18,762 --> 00:43:21,562
Hi, gang. Well, we're

707
00:43:21,562 --> 00:43:24,282
out at Enterprise Dog Park on Saturday

708
00:43:24,282 --> 00:43:27,242
afternoon, and it's just so beautiful out

709
00:43:27,242 --> 00:43:30,082
here. We've got all of

710
00:43:30,122 --> 00:43:32,522
the different insect noises, and they're

711
00:43:32,522 --> 00:43:35,202
just buzzing and zzzzing, and it just

712
00:43:35,202 --> 00:43:37,082
reminds me of my childhood.

713
00:43:39,162 --> 00:43:40,683
All of the nights here and all the

714
00:43:40,683 --> 00:43:42,963
cicadas out outside. And

715
00:43:44,443 --> 00:43:46,203
And then you get out here and it's just

716
00:43:46,203 --> 00:43:48,843
so peaceful, other than me

717
00:43:48,843 --> 00:43:51,163
talking right now. But yeah.

718
00:43:52,883 --> 00:43:53,483
Listen to that.

719
00:44:07,623 --> 00:44:10,423
What the fuckWow.

720
00:44:13,303 --> 00:44:14,263
So peaceful.

721
00:44:18,743 --> 00:44:21,103
Hi, little buddy. Little

722
00:44:21,543 --> 00:44:24,343
polar bear, I'm sorry we're keeping you

723
00:44:24,343 --> 00:44:26,623
so long haired, hopefully we can correct

724
00:44:26,623 --> 00:44:27,383
that soon.

725
00:44:29,643 --> 00:44:32,203
Hope that Southpaw Dog Spa on

726
00:44:32,523 --> 00:44:34,523
Drew Street in Clearwater will give us a

727
00:44:34,523 --> 00:44:36,443
call back pretty please.

728
00:44:38,683 --> 00:44:41,003
I was baker acted twice, just so you

729
00:44:41,003 --> 00:44:43,564
know. I meant no harm. It

730
00:44:43,564 --> 00:44:46,284
was completely out of my control because

731
00:44:46,284 --> 00:44:48,324
I was assaulted by my neighbor, David

732
00:44:48,324 --> 00:44:50,684
Rosen. Okay, so anyway, I've gotta go

733
00:44:50,684 --> 00:44:51,164
right now.

734
00:44:54,844 --> 00:44:57,644
So anyway. Alright, gang. This is

735
00:44:57,724 --> 00:45:00,364
Stacey, one half of my ninjas.

736
00:45:00,364 --> 00:45:03,284
There's Matt. Hi. This is Matt

737
00:45:03,284 --> 00:45:05,804
and Stacey, by the way, hun. Hi. Okay,

738
00:45:05,804 --> 00:45:08,044
she's gonna take Max back, I guess. He

739
00:45:08,044 --> 00:45:10,684
wants to go back. I got it. But you can

740
00:45:10,684 --> 00:45:13,084
carry him this way, too. Yeah, here you

741
00:45:13,084 --> 00:45:13,684
go, babe. Hello, Matt.

742
00:45:16,524 --> 00:45:18,844
Hi, gang. Well,

743
00:45:19,244 --> 00:45:22,084
so anyway. All right, gang. This is

744
00:45:22,204 --> 00:45:25,164
Stacey, one half of my ninjas. There's

745
00:45:25,164 --> 00:45:27,884
Matt. Hi, this is Matt and

746
00:45:27,884 --> 00:45:30,844
Stacy, by the way. OK, she's going to

747
00:45:30,844 --> 00:45:33,164
take Max back. I guess he wants to go

748
00:45:33,164 --> 00:45:36,044
back. But you can carry him this way

749
00:45:36,044 --> 00:45:38,124
too. Yeah, here you go, babe.

750
00:45:40,044 --> 00:45:41,724
Here and you can take this too.

751
00:45:45,645 --> 00:45:47,885
I know Max we're going. Thank you. Thank

752
00:45:47,885 --> 00:45:50,365
you babe. I love you. Thank you.

753
00:45:50,605 --> 00:45:52,605
Keep that air conditioning primed and

754
00:45:52,605 --> 00:45:54,445
cool. Ohh

755
00:45:55,805 --> 00:45:57,005
It's Jax, right?

756
00:45:58,765 --> 00:45:59,645
Your dog's name?Darce!

757
00:46:01,005 --> 00:46:03,005
Darcy. Darce.

758
00:46:03,805 --> 00:46:06,605
Darcy. Darce. Darce. Just Darce or

759
00:46:06,605 --> 00:46:09,165
Darcy?Darce. Darce.

760
00:46:09,805 --> 00:46:12,045
Okay. So, anyway, you're going to be on

761
00:46:12,045 --> 00:46:14,845
my sixth installment. Actually, I mean...

762
00:46:15,805 --> 00:46:17,645
Not that you really have a choice in it,

763
00:46:17,725 --> 00:46:20,685
but... Anyway. No, so what

764
00:46:20,685 --> 00:46:23,405
I've been doing is I've created a

765
00:46:23,405 --> 00:46:25,925
new YouTube channel. called,

766
00:46:26,765 --> 00:46:28,845
and I gotta get these dogs some water

767
00:46:28,845 --> 00:46:30,725
here. We're going too fast. Let's slow

768
00:46:30,725 --> 00:46:32,365
down a little bit. We're on a time crime.

769
00:46:32,605 --> 00:46:33,765
You are?What are you doing?We have

770
00:46:34,005 --> 00:46:35,565
friends coming over. Okay.

771
00:46:37,245 --> 00:46:40,205
But, But so what I do then is,

772
00:46:40,205 --> 00:46:42,125
so then on my home show, what I do is I

773
00:46:42,525 --> 00:46:44,726
go through my Google Photos album, and

774
00:46:44,726 --> 00:46:46,646
then I literally just pull these up and

775
00:46:46,686 --> 00:46:48,846
play them along for them. But it makes

776
00:46:48,846 --> 00:46:51,246
for, for me, like a really fun end of my

777
00:46:51,246 --> 00:46:54,126
day, so every day I make my little home

778
00:46:54,126 --> 00:46:56,606
show just about. And so I've got...

779
00:46:57,446 --> 00:46:59,486
I'm building something called... Here,

780
00:46:59,486 --> 00:47:02,206
let's go. Let's... I was just trying to

781
00:47:02,206 --> 00:47:04,126
do the water thing, but I'm I'm a little

782
00:47:04,126 --> 00:47:06,286
bit, uh.. So anyway...

783
00:47:07,486 --> 00:47:09,246
No, I was trying to do the water thing.

784
00:47:09,326 --> 00:47:12,046
I'm not trying to hold you up, but... It

785
00:47:12,046 --> 00:47:14,726
is cool to see you. And any new movies or

786
00:47:14,726 --> 00:47:15,326
anything?

787
00:47:17,966 --> 00:47:20,606
No. Series. I don't know.

788
00:47:20,846 --> 00:47:23,406
Wednesday on Netflix. I kind of want to

789
00:47:23,406 --> 00:47:25,246
see it. And then there's also that one

790
00:47:25,246 --> 00:47:27,726
with that wrestler guy. What's his name?

791
00:47:28,366 --> 00:47:29,526
You know what I'm talking about?It's on

792
00:47:29,526 --> 00:47:31,366
Netflix, though. You don't have Netflix.

793
00:47:31,366 --> 00:47:33,486
Yeah, we do. He's like the Punisher. He's

794
00:47:33,486 --> 00:47:36,206
like... But it's comical and fun.

795
00:47:36,566 --> 00:47:39,486
He's like... He's the

796
00:47:39,486 --> 00:47:41,966
wrestler dude that's not The Rock.

797
00:47:43,966 --> 00:47:46,847
John Cena?Yes! John Cena!ohh But

798
00:47:47,007 --> 00:47:49,167
yeah, it's a it's a pretty cool show, or

799
00:47:49,207 --> 00:47:50,487
at least what I've watched of it. What's

800
00:47:50,527 --> 00:47:53,487
our own bad gins, or--

801
00:47:53,567 --> 00:47:54,447
we're going to AMC,

802
00:47:56,927 --> 00:47:59,727
but not . But yet, generally

803
00:47:59,727 --> 00:48:01,967
speaking, so what what my goal is, is

804
00:48:01,967 --> 00:48:04,447
like, if I go to the dog park,

805
00:48:04,767 --> 00:48:06,767
whatever I do, I'm trying to like

806
00:48:07,567 --> 00:48:10,287
document as much of my life as possible

807
00:48:10,847 --> 00:48:13,527
and profusely share it. You can't steal

808
00:48:13,527 --> 00:48:15,887
what's given freely. Right?And I know

809
00:48:15,927 --> 00:48:17,647
that sounds crazy, but it's like,

810
00:48:18,847 --> 00:48:20,607
you can't stop the inevitable.

811
00:48:21,567 --> 00:48:21,887
So...

812
00:48:25,967 --> 00:48:26,447
Here.

813
00:48:30,607 --> 00:48:32,647
The sound here is great. I was really

814
00:48:32,647 --> 00:48:35,327
enjoying the piece, but I got really

815
00:48:35,327 --> 00:48:37,327
manic when I saw you guys. So I was...

816
00:48:38,607 --> 00:48:41,527
HuhProtest. Oh, I slowed down for it

817
00:48:41,527 --> 00:48:43,207
and everybody got pissed at me. They

818
00:48:45,807 --> 00:48:47,207
were giving thumbs downs. I was just

819
00:48:47,207 --> 00:48:48,968
trying to read the signs. We thought it

820
00:48:48,968 --> 00:48:51,848
would be funny to go get some

821
00:48:51,968 --> 00:48:54,408
shoe polish. What were they protesting?

822
00:48:54,408 --> 00:48:56,208
Trump. They were?Yeah.

823
00:48:57,008 --> 00:48:59,408
Oh. Whatever, I don't know why. No, I

824
00:48:59,448 --> 00:49:01,008
think they were all protesting different

825
00:49:01,008 --> 00:49:03,488
shitNo, they're all anti Trump. Oh.

826
00:49:04,688 --> 00:49:07,168
But we thought it'd be fun yeah to go get

827
00:49:07,248 --> 00:49:08,528
some shoe polish because they got their

828
00:49:08,528 --> 00:49:09,888
cars all parked there. Right. They were

829
00:49:09,888 --> 00:49:11,808
like trumped for life on their car. I saw

830
00:49:11,808 --> 00:49:14,208
some interesting things. I read

831
00:49:14,208 --> 00:49:15,808
everything. I'm not going to like

832
00:49:16,928 --> 00:49:19,608
exclude ideas. Come on guys,

833
00:49:19,608 --> 00:49:21,008
Daisy, Darce.

834
00:49:22,688 --> 00:49:24,128
But I'm not going to exclude

835
00:49:24,928 --> 00:49:27,728
ideas like most of the lip

836
00:49:27,768 --> 00:49:29,648
parts do, which is really interesting.

837
00:49:29,968 --> 00:49:32,128
It's a word that my brother quainted or

838
00:49:32,128 --> 00:49:34,208
that I first heard from my brother.

839
00:49:34,608 --> 00:49:36,688
That's when I was, in fact, a libtard.

840
00:49:37,248 --> 00:49:40,048
There's nothing wrong with being liberal,

841
00:49:40,048 --> 00:49:41,768
you just have to be-- No, I just, but but

842
00:49:41,768 --> 00:49:43,608
that was under essentially a different

843
00:49:43,608 --> 00:49:45,648
paradigm, a different system entirely.

844
00:49:45,648 --> 00:49:47,608
Right. There's nothing wrong with being

845
00:49:47,728 --> 00:49:49,008
liberal, you just have to be willing to

846
00:49:49,128 --> 00:49:51,489
talk to somebody about it. Well, the main

847
00:49:51,489 --> 00:49:53,969
thing is is like I'm a total beneficiary

848
00:49:54,009 --> 00:49:56,929
of like the government spending, right?So

849
00:49:56,929 --> 00:49:59,569
like were it not for my VA disability,

850
00:50:00,209 --> 00:50:03,169
I would be totally hosed, so I am so

851
00:50:03,169 --> 00:50:05,849
gratefulto the VA and to

852
00:50:05,849 --> 00:50:08,449
my to my civilization,

853
00:50:08,729 --> 00:50:11,169
which has granted me this lease on life

854
00:50:11,169 --> 00:50:13,689
that otherwise I would not have. But I

855
00:50:13,929 --> 00:50:15,409
always thought what his cuts would be--

856
00:50:16,129 --> 00:50:18,009
the systems were a little misinterpreted.

857
00:50:18,089 --> 00:50:20,369
Like it was-- I don't know enough to make

858
00:50:20,369 --> 00:50:22,289
an informed decision on that. Generally

859
00:50:22,289 --> 00:50:24,009
speaking, everything that I know about

860
00:50:24,009 --> 00:50:25,969
Trump is that he

861
00:50:27,089 --> 00:50:29,329
might be the devil, but he's also,

862
00:50:29,329 --> 00:50:31,969
generally speaking, pretty good. And

863
00:50:31,969 --> 00:50:34,849
better than than Biden ever was.

864
00:50:35,089 --> 00:50:37,569
And I kind of think of him as my naked

865
00:50:37,569 --> 00:50:38,769
soul brother, actually.

866
00:50:40,769 --> 00:50:43,489
Like genuinely, I think of him like like

867
00:50:43,489 --> 00:50:45,889
we're just a divided soul.

868
00:50:47,489 --> 00:50:50,289
He got the luckier like

869
00:50:51,009 --> 00:50:53,170
plot in life or whatever, you know?

870
00:50:58,810 --> 00:51:00,610
But thanks for letting me record this.

871
00:51:00,610 --> 00:51:01,970
But I'm going to put this on the show,

872
00:51:02,130 --> 00:51:03,810
and you can watch it if you want. Or you

873
00:51:03,810 --> 00:51:05,970
can send it to people if you want. Or you

874
00:51:05,970 --> 00:51:06,530
don't have to. Ohh So

875
00:51:11,770 --> 00:51:13,690
what you been doing?Just hanging out?I've

876
00:51:13,690 --> 00:51:16,450
been, so I've been,

877
00:51:17,570 --> 00:51:20,290
at least my front room out to Ahmed, who

878
00:51:20,290 --> 00:51:23,050
you probably know from here. And

879
00:51:23,050 --> 00:51:24,930
Ahmed with the two German Shepherds,

880
00:51:24,930 --> 00:51:26,930
Diesel and Mila, long haired.

881
00:51:28,010 --> 00:51:30,690
He's always here, and his girlfriend is

882
00:51:30,690 --> 00:51:32,770
Erica and she's-- That's the big dog that

883
00:51:33,330 --> 00:51:34,810
carries the stick, is that him?Nah,

884
00:51:34,810 --> 00:51:37,650
that's somebody else. But anyway, Ahmed

885
00:51:38,370 --> 00:51:41,250
is currently renting my

886
00:51:41,250 --> 00:51:44,050
front room, and then I have somebody

887
00:51:44,050 --> 00:51:47,010
renting my back room, and I even have

888
00:51:47,010 --> 00:51:49,010
somebody renting my front porch, who I

889
00:51:49,010 --> 00:51:51,810
call Samwise Gamgee. Ohh And

890
00:51:51,810 --> 00:51:54,691
his name is actually Ken. But it's not

891
00:51:54,691 --> 00:51:56,611
even climate controlled, but he's totally

892
00:51:56,611 --> 00:51:58,291
chill with that because he was homeless

893
00:51:58,291 --> 00:52:01,171
for like two years before anybody would

894
00:52:01,171 --> 00:52:03,491
even give him a front porch to put his

895
00:52:03,891 --> 00:52:05,731
address at, right?How much did you charge

896
00:52:06,771 --> 00:52:08,571
for your front porch?400.

897
00:52:10,851 --> 00:52:13,491
Which is fair. And that really goes, I

898
00:52:13,491 --> 00:52:16,211
mean, it's not like I live

899
00:52:16,211 --> 00:52:18,251
large. I'm just disabled,

900
00:52:18,531 --> 00:52:19,331
actually.

901
00:52:22,771 --> 00:52:25,611
not extorting them. No, and

902
00:52:25,611 --> 00:52:27,331
actually St. Vincent de Paul is the one

903
00:52:27,331 --> 00:52:29,171
that's paying the bill, and I interviewed

904
00:52:29,171 --> 00:52:31,771
with them. And I took an independent

905
00:52:31,771 --> 00:52:34,331
survey of my neighbors and asked them how

906
00:52:34,331 --> 00:52:35,971
much they would charge for a similar

907
00:52:35,971 --> 00:52:38,611
space. And each one of them told me that

908
00:52:38,611 --> 00:52:41,491
it would be uh more than that. I

909
00:52:41,651 --> 00:52:43,571
thought you were in a condo. Yeah, I am.

910
00:52:44,211 --> 00:52:46,211
Generally speaking, my landlord is pretty

911
00:52:46,211 --> 00:52:46,611
cool.

912
00:52:52,491 --> 00:52:53,651
No hard feelings.

913
00:52:55,492 --> 00:52:57,932
So what, he's still doing this?I'm trying

914
00:52:57,932 --> 00:52:58,572
to. Huh

915
00:53:01,252 --> 00:53:04,052
I had a really manic episode like three

916
00:53:04,052 --> 00:53:06,612
weeks ago because I have this this butt

917
00:53:06,612 --> 00:53:08,692
head neighbor who I let kind of get the

918
00:53:08,692 --> 00:53:11,132
better of me, but it was because he had

919
00:53:11,132 --> 00:53:13,932
said something about, he said I was I was

920
00:53:13,932 --> 00:53:16,372
a snitch and I didn't serve.

921
00:53:16,652 --> 00:53:19,132
And when he said I didn't serve, I mean,

922
00:53:19,132 --> 00:53:21,972
I literally get my income from my

923
00:53:22,412 --> 00:53:25,252
be a disability, right?And so

924
00:53:25,732 --> 00:53:28,212
I've never met a veteran in my life

925
00:53:29,092 --> 00:53:31,972
who would like bespirch another and

926
00:53:31,972 --> 00:53:34,852
say, oh, you didn't serve or whatever. I

927
00:53:34,852 --> 00:53:37,332
mean, like I legitimately have tags on my

928
00:53:37,332 --> 00:53:39,252
vehicle, but I got my-- The only

929
00:53:39,252 --> 00:53:41,252
distinction I've I've ever heard between

930
00:53:41,252 --> 00:53:43,132
veterans is like you could be a veteran

931
00:53:43,132 --> 00:53:44,932
and you could be a combat veteran. Well,

932
00:53:45,012 --> 00:53:47,492
I mean, my my ship was involved in an

933
00:53:47,492 --> 00:53:50,212
international incident, which almost, I

934
00:53:50,212 --> 00:53:52,452
mean,could have killed everybody aboard

935
00:53:52,452 --> 00:53:54,772
right before I went aboard. Well, my my

936
00:53:54,772 --> 00:53:56,773
grandfather always took issue with that

937
00:53:56,853 --> 00:53:59,653
because he he was, he would

938
00:53:59,653 --> 00:54:02,453
get, so he served in the Navy when there

939
00:54:02,453 --> 00:54:05,053
wasn't a wartime. It was always wartime

940
00:54:05,053 --> 00:54:07,093
in the submarine service. Well, always.

941
00:54:07,093 --> 00:54:09,053
No, no, no, I'm not talking about you.

942
00:54:09,253 --> 00:54:10,613
I'm just talking about you. Yeah. Silent

943
00:54:10,653 --> 00:54:13,333
war. It's kind of a reverse of your name

944
00:54:13,333 --> 00:54:15,973
you're talking about because he felt like

945
00:54:16,373 --> 00:54:18,173
when people would give, he felt like he

946
00:54:18,173 --> 00:54:20,453
didn't deserveLike his friends, they got

947
00:54:20,453 --> 00:54:22,133
the same Vietnam and Korea treatment, if

948
00:54:22,573 --> 00:54:24,133
that makes sense. You know what I mean?He

949
00:54:24,133 --> 00:54:26,133
would say, Memorial Day is not for me.

950
00:54:27,173 --> 00:54:28,333
I'm talking to you, I'm talking to that

951
00:54:28,333 --> 00:54:31,253
person. Hey, come on, man. This is for

952
00:54:31,253 --> 00:54:33,213
posterity. I don't even know what that

953
00:54:33,253 --> 00:54:35,973
means. Posterity?Yeah. It

954
00:54:35,973 --> 00:54:38,613
means that we're saying hello to the

955
00:54:38,693 --> 00:54:41,453
universe. This This makes it up the--

956
00:54:41,453 --> 00:54:43,173
Well, that's not the universe, this is

957
00:54:43,333 --> 00:54:44,533
the universe. But this is an

958
00:54:44,533 --> 00:54:47,493
amplification medium. And what this

959
00:54:47,493 --> 00:54:49,573
does is, this sends out like this

960
00:54:49,573 --> 00:54:52,213
massive, well, for me, this vibrational

961
00:54:52,213 --> 00:54:55,093
joy energy out to the universe, where I'm

962
00:54:55,093 --> 00:54:57,974
like silently going, Hakuna matata!

963
00:54:58,614 --> 00:55:01,094
What a wonderful phrase! It

964
00:55:01,094 --> 00:55:03,814
means no worries for the rest of your

965
00:55:03,814 --> 00:55:06,454
days. So, that's what I'm

966
00:55:06,454 --> 00:55:07,494
actually doing.

967
00:55:09,814 --> 00:55:12,054
Is I'm actually saying, Thank you, Mother

968
00:55:12,054 --> 00:55:14,574
Gaia, for this beautiful cathedral you've

969
00:55:14,574 --> 00:55:17,414
gifted us. Thank you, Father God for

970
00:55:17,414 --> 00:55:19,334
this perfect day. Speaking of

971
00:55:20,134 --> 00:55:21,734
perfect day, guess what we're doing next

972
00:55:22,654 --> 00:55:24,414
week?Ah, what are you doing next week?A

973
00:55:24,734 --> 00:55:27,254
week, almost a week. Okay. We're going up

974
00:55:27,894 --> 00:55:29,774
to Glacier National Park. I'm so jealous.

975
00:55:29,774 --> 00:55:30,774
We're doing Glacier, Yellowstone, and

976
00:55:31,894 --> 00:55:34,814
Green Tucson. I think

977
00:55:34,814 --> 00:55:36,774
I'm gonna go to my brother's next week

978
00:55:36,814 --> 00:55:39,014
and and go to Seneca Rocks or something

979
00:55:39,014 --> 00:55:41,974
like that. I hope on Monday, right

980
00:55:41,974 --> 00:55:43,574
after my job interview, ah

981
00:55:46,094 --> 00:55:48,134
And then we're gonna... Yeah, I haven't

982
00:55:48,134 --> 00:55:50,814
worked in a while. I'm really serious

983
00:55:50,814 --> 00:55:53,254
about building the Angel OS, where

984
00:55:53,254 --> 00:55:55,494
everyone gets an angel, even you get an

985
00:55:55,494 --> 00:55:57,014
angel and you get an angel,

986
00:55:57,894 --> 00:56:00,735
everybody gets an angel. But what it does

987
00:56:00,735 --> 00:56:03,535
is it's like, it's like, did you

988
00:56:03,535 --> 00:56:05,575
ever watch Transformers the movie?

989
00:56:06,615 --> 00:56:09,375
Okay, now imagine Optimus Prime,

990
00:56:09,655 --> 00:56:12,255
right?He goes, Ahh! and it turns in, but

991
00:56:12,255 --> 00:56:13,895
they can actually turn into more than

992
00:56:13,895 --> 00:56:15,735
just like their main vehicle, you know?

993
00:56:16,295 --> 00:56:19,015
Well, that's exactly what I've

994
00:56:19,415 --> 00:56:22,295
built. It is a multi-channel

995
00:56:24,055 --> 00:56:26,255
everything clone. Yeah, we're going to

996
00:56:26,335 --> 00:56:28,295
try... Which copies itself. We're going

997
00:56:28,295 --> 00:56:31,095
to try and go right there. Okay,

998
00:56:31,095 --> 00:56:33,135
let me see it on the... Hold it up to the

999
00:56:33,135 --> 00:56:35,255
camera. Thank you, right there. We'll

1000
00:56:35,255 --> 00:56:37,775
talk to you. I don't know if we'll make

1001
00:56:39,255 --> 00:56:41,455
it. It's so awesome, but what you have to

1002
00:56:41,455 --> 00:56:43,335
do is you have to go get like a Hohem

1003
00:56:43,535 --> 00:56:46,455
iDroid gimbal mount. Right?

1004
00:56:47,575 --> 00:56:50,495
Dude! But I want

1005
00:56:50,535 --> 00:56:53,375
you to share that moment with me and

1006
00:56:53,495 --> 00:56:56,135
do it with a GoPro. Like

1007
00:56:56,215 --> 00:56:58,935
this right here. No, I'm serious. I'm

1008
00:56:59,375 --> 00:57:02,136
not dying. Because you

1009
00:57:02,136 --> 00:57:04,976
guys are so awesome. I would really watch

1010
00:57:05,416 --> 00:57:07,816
your channel if you had one like the one

1011
00:57:07,816 --> 00:57:10,576
that I have. Honestly, and I would even

1012
00:57:10,576 --> 00:57:12,936
plug your channel, if you have the one.

1013
00:57:14,296 --> 00:57:17,096
Yes it is to me. You're like some of the

1014
00:57:17,096 --> 00:57:19,416
most interesting people I know. I mean,

1015
00:57:19,416 --> 00:57:22,296
Matt is like a senior top

1016
00:57:22,296 --> 00:57:25,016
level Audi e-tron tech and

1017
00:57:25,016 --> 00:57:27,896
everything else. I can't even get a job

1018
00:57:27,896 --> 00:57:29,816
at his dealership, but this man's like,

1019
00:57:30,056 --> 00:57:32,256
it's the top dude in his dealership.

1020
00:57:32,696 --> 00:57:35,336
Actually, and I know it for a fact,

1021
00:57:35,416 --> 00:57:35,856
right there.

1022
00:57:38,336 --> 00:57:40,216
I'm going to do a different medium. We're

1023
00:57:40,216 --> 00:57:41,656
flying into Denver. Right.

1024
00:57:43,816 --> 00:57:45,656
Daisy. Where the magical mushrooms are

1025
00:57:45,656 --> 00:57:48,496
legal. They're legal here. It

1026
00:57:48,496 --> 00:57:51,016
depends on the kind. And since I've never

1027
00:57:51,016 --> 00:57:53,536
had an experience at all, no matter what

1028
00:57:53,536 --> 00:57:55,256
experience I have, it's going to be

1029
00:57:55,256 --> 00:57:58,216
great. Ohh But not

1030
00:57:58,216 --> 00:58:00,296
as great as the strawberry shortcake that

1031
00:58:00,296 --> 00:58:02,416
I got it purely right before I came here.

1032
00:58:02,536 --> 00:58:05,417
What?So, it

1033
00:58:06,137 --> 00:58:07,577
seems pretty. There you go.

1034
00:58:15,817 --> 00:58:17,737
So yeah, this is totally going

1035
00:58:22,617 --> 00:58:24,657
up. Bud, thanks for letting me interview

1036
00:58:24,657 --> 00:58:25,337
you a little bit.

1037
00:58:28,857 --> 00:58:31,737
No problem. What a beautiful

1038
00:58:31,737 --> 00:58:33,017
day, and then I missed out-- You should

1039
00:58:33,017 --> 00:58:34,137
be out there and interview some of them

1040
00:58:34,937 --> 00:58:37,897
Trump-- No!Good afternoon.

1041
00:58:37,897 --> 00:58:40,217
Thanks for petting the Regal one. That's

1042
00:58:40,217 --> 00:58:42,137
my daughter, actually. That's my

1043
00:58:42,137 --> 00:58:44,337
daughter. Hey, what are you guys mad

1044
00:58:44,337 --> 00:58:47,177
about?Here. So this

1045
00:58:47,177 --> 00:58:48,537
is like a single take.

1046
00:58:52,297 --> 00:58:54,617
I can't flip it around. I've got this pro

1047
00:58:54,617 --> 00:58:56,457
mode on this S23 going. What

1048
00:59:00,057 --> 00:59:02,457
are you driving up?Well, today it's the

1049
00:59:02,457 --> 00:59:04,057
Cadillac CTS.

1050
00:59:05,058 --> 00:59:07,098
3-liter performance, all-wheel drive.

1051
00:59:08,378 --> 00:59:11,178
It is a 4-door

1052
00:59:11,178 --> 00:59:13,738
Corvette powered by a

1053
00:59:13,738 --> 00:59:15,578
SwissWatch power plant. You got that

1054
00:59:15,578 --> 00:59:18,058
truck still?Uh, I got

1055
00:59:18,698 --> 00:59:21,178
the Soul Van. Oh yeah, that's right. Right

1056
00:59:21,258 --> 00:59:23,538
It's It's actually, I call it the

1057
00:59:23,578 --> 00:59:25,858
USS Enterprise. I'm

1058
00:59:27,498 --> 00:59:30,298
serious. It's the namesake of

1059
00:59:30,378 --> 00:59:32,818
the enterprise fleet. I'm telling you, I

1060
00:59:32,818 --> 00:59:34,538
am writing Ready Player

1061
00:59:34,858 --> 00:59:37,778
Everyone, where everybody gets

1062
00:59:37,778 --> 00:59:40,658
an Angel, sponsored by the Angel OS. And

1063
00:59:40,658 --> 00:59:43,018
I'm telling you, it's a real

1064
00:59:43,018 --> 00:59:45,378
thing. And once the Angel OS

1065
00:59:45,378 --> 00:59:47,418
emerges, it's going to

1066
00:59:47,418 --> 00:59:50,138
transform the economy in

1067
00:59:50,138 --> 00:59:52,138
really awesome ways. Because I don't know

1068
00:59:52,138 --> 00:59:53,858
how it's going to do it, but it's an

1069
00:59:53,858 --> 00:59:55,658
emergent ecosystem of

1070
00:59:56,778 --> 00:59:59,738
a Swiss Army knife,awesome,

1071
00:59:59,738 --> 01:00:02,538
top-of-class, it's

1072
01:00:02,538 --> 01:00:05,258
called a content management

1073
01:00:05,258 --> 01:00:07,579
system, which is called Payload CMS,

1074
01:00:07,579 --> 01:00:10,299
built on top of Next.js, which is like

1075
01:00:10,619 --> 01:00:13,099
the best development

1076
01:00:13,099 --> 01:00:16,019
framework for enterprises. So this is all

1077
01:00:16,019 --> 01:00:18,219
like top-level enterprise

1078
01:00:18,219 --> 01:00:20,939
architecture that can run on your

1079
01:00:21,019 --> 01:00:23,819
own box in your own office,

1080
01:00:24,379 --> 01:00:27,339
with your own models. And so literally,

1081
01:00:27,339 --> 01:00:29,859
actually, it's HIPAA compliant,

1082
01:00:31,099 --> 01:00:33,899
but and it can create any kind of

1083
01:00:33,899 --> 01:00:36,539
website that you need. If you need a

1084
01:00:36,859 --> 01:00:39,339
GoFundMe, it creates that. If you want

1085
01:00:39,939 --> 01:00:42,699
an OnlyFans, it can be an OnlyFans. If

1086
01:00:42,699 --> 01:00:45,579
you're a therapist, it can create a a

1087
01:00:45,819 --> 01:00:48,699
personal therapy. If it could create a

1088
01:00:48,699 --> 01:00:51,579
suicide hotline, it can do

1089
01:00:51,899 --> 01:00:54,139
literally, actually, anything.

1090
01:00:56,259 --> 01:00:58,539
Not a lot. And then I'm I'm like days

1091
01:00:58,539 --> 01:01:01,099
away from

1092
01:01:03,179 --> 01:01:04,379
a, what do you call it?

1093
01:01:06,059 --> 01:01:08,940
Well, minimum viable

1094
01:01:08,940 --> 01:01:11,740
product and so. But I have all of

1095
01:01:11,740 --> 01:01:13,660
these things working independently, and

1096
01:01:13,660 --> 01:01:16,380
I've built roughly 33 separate Next.js

1097
01:01:16,860 --> 01:01:19,820
sites, actually. And I have over

1098
01:01:19,820 --> 01:01:22,580
6,000 hours of coding and all of this

1099
01:01:22,580 --> 01:01:25,020
stuff. So, I mean, I'm deadly serious

1100
01:01:25,020 --> 01:01:27,500
about building the Angel OS, where

1101
01:01:27,660 --> 01:01:29,980
everyone gets an angel. And

1102
01:01:30,300 --> 01:01:33,020
anyway, Matt and Stacy. Good to see you.

1103
01:01:33,020 --> 01:01:35,020
Thank you so much for the interview.

1104
01:01:36,540 --> 01:01:38,300

1105

everything else. Have a great one.

1106
01:01:57,340 --> 01:02:00,060
Woo! Man, that truck is sexy.

1107
01:02:00,820 --> 01:02:01,900

1113
01:02:32,801 --> 01:02:34,401

01:02:34,401 --> 01:02:37,121
I'm chilling. It's kind of warm out here.

1115
01:02:37,441 --> 01:02:39,121
Jump, Daisy. Jump. Good girl! Ha ha!

1116
01:02:39,121 --> 01:02:41,121

HuhHe took literally,

1120
01:02:52,461 --> 01:02:54,221
I saw a human characteristic and he

1121
01:02:54,221 --> 01:02:57,141
rolled his eyes and head back. Is he a

1122
01:02:57,141 --> 01:02:59,821
Uh.. No, she did

1123
01:02:59,821 --> 01:03:02,061
great. She actually made it on her own

1124
01:03:02,061 --> 01:03:04,781
power. That's such a

1125
01:03:04,781 --> 01:03:05,901
sexy truck. What?

1126
01:03:09,021 --> 01:03:09,981
No, I can't.

1127
01:03:13,342 --> 01:03:16,302
No, I'm fine, babe. I'm just a

1128
01:03:16,302 --> 01:03:18,062
little manic. No, I'm not manic at all.

1129
01:03:18,222 --> 01:03:19,982
I'm completely fine. I'm just having fun.

1130
01:03:19,982 --> 01:03:21,742
I just want to get that drive away. It's
