## Summary

As a visionary Full Stack Programmer Analyst with over 20 years of experience, I excel in crafting sophisticated web applications and innovative AI-driven solutions. My passion is rooted in modern JavaScript frameworks, with particular proficiency in NextJS and PayloadCMS â€” my go-to stack for building scalable, efficient, production-ready platforms.

My technical expertise extends to Strapi, Vue.JS, React, and enterprise frameworks like C#/.NET, ASP.NET, DotNetNuke, and SharePoint. I am proficient in cloud deployment (Azure, Vercel) and skilled at efficient data transfer, integration, and large-scale systems optimization.

My formative training in the U.S. Navy Nuclear Propulsion Program instilled analytical rigor, discipline, and adaptability â€” strengths I apply to complex software development challenges in dynamic environments.

**Current Focus**: Leading the development of Angel OS, a multi-tenant business platform that combines workspace collaboration, CRM, e-commerce, and AI assistance while maintaining constitutional principles of human-centered technology.
