# Lightweight AI Contact Form - Revised Proposal

## Executive Summary

I can deliver this complete embeddable contact form solution using a streamlined Next.js approach. No need for Angel OS complexity - this is a focused, single-purpose tool that can be built efficiently and deployed quickly.

**Budget: $900** (Fixed price, delivered by Monday)

## Technical Approach

### Core Stack (Minimal & Fast)
- **Next.js 14** with App Router (TypeScript)
- **MongoDB** for simple data storage
- **ShadCN UI + Tailwind** for dashboard
- **Stripe Checkout** for payments
- **Google Calendar API** for booking

### Why This Approach Works
- **No Angel OS overhead** - Single-purpose app, not multi-tenant platform
- **No Payload CMS needed** - Simple forms don't need content management
- **Proven stack** - I've built similar widgets dozens of times
- **Fast deployment** - Vercel + MongoDB Atlas = 5-minute setup

## Deliverables (Complete V1)

### 1. Embeddable Widget (`loader.min.js` < 10KB)
```html
<!-- One-line GTM embed -->
<script src="https://your-domain.com/loader.min.js" data-site-key="abc123"></script>
```

**Features:**
- Shadow DOM isolation (styles won't conflict)
- Multi-step form: Message â†’ Schedule toggle
- Mobile-responsive, accessible
- SPA route change detection

### 2. Attribution & Privacy (IAB TCF 2.2 Compliant)
**Tracking:**
- UTM parameters (source, medium, campaign, etc.)
- Click IDs (gclid, fbclid, msclkid)
- First/last touch attribution
- Referrer and landing page
- SPA navigation path

**Privacy:**
- `__tcfapi` integration for consent
- Honor Do Not Track headers
- Form works even if tracking disabled
- GDPR/CCPA compliant data handling

### 3. Instant Booking Integration
- Inline Google Calendar slot picker
- OAuth2 authentication flow
- Real calendar event creation
- Automatic confirmation emails

### 4. A/B Testing (Light)
- CTA text variations
- Impression/click tracking
- Auto-promote winner (statistical significance)
- Real-time performance metrics

### 5. Dashboard (Clean & Functional)
**Views:**
- **Leads**: Contact info + full attribution data
- **Channels**: First/last touch toggle analysis
- **Settings**: GTM snippet, consent defaults, cookie TTL
- **A/B Tests**: Performance metrics and winner selection

### 6. Stripe Integration
- Trial and Pro plan checkout
- Webhook handling for plan changes
- Usage limits enforcement
- Billing management

## Data Model (Simple & Effective)

```typescript
// Core collections (6 total)
Lead: { contact, message, booked, eventId, attribution, consent, createdAt }
Attribution: { leadId, firstTouch, lastTouch, utms, clickIds, referrer, landing }
Experiment: { key, variants[], winner, isActive }
Settings: { gtmSnippet, consentDefaults, cookieTTL, calendarConfig }
Account: { plan, stripeCustomerId, limits }
Event: { leadId, googleEventId, startsAt, endsAt }
```

## Development Approach

### Phase 1: Foundation
- Next.js project setup with TypeScript
- MongoDB connection and basic schemas
- Authentication setup (NextAuth)

### Phase 2: Widget Core
- Embeddable script with Shadow DOM
- Multi-step form component

### Phase 3: Integrations
