A laid‑back, one‑take freestyle kicks off this ClearwaterCruisin’ ride. I’m at home scrolling Google Photos, reliving moments from the road — singing in the USS Enterprise (SoulVan1), bits from The Fifth Element, everyday scenes, and a slow‑roll tribute lap for Hulk Hogan on the eve of his passing. No script, no filter — just music, movies, ministry, and real life flowing together.

About Clearwater Cruisin’ Ministries
Broadcasting the Outlaw Gospel from the Edge of the Simulation.
We’re not here to escape the matrix — we’re here to refactor it.
Clearwater Cruisin’ Ministries is a rolling soul caravan: part street ministry, part tech manifesto, part open-source spirituality.
Our mission: spread the Outlaw Gospel, debug reality, and deliver hope anywhere wheels can roll — flea markets, causeways, Walmart parking lots, car shows, and swap meets.
Here you’ll find:
🚐 SoulFleet dispatches – real-world missions, livestreams, and roadside sermons
⚡ Angel OS development – building a soul-aligned operating system for humanity
🎥 Field reports – political protest, spiritual warfare, and divine resilience
💡 Neo-spiritual tools – bridging technology, mysticism, and street-level outreach
If you’ve ever felt the simulation glitch, if you believe in angels and algorithms, or if you just want to see a ministry that runs on love, coffee, and lithium‑ion batteries… welcome aboard.
Always be excellent to each other — and party on, tastefully.
