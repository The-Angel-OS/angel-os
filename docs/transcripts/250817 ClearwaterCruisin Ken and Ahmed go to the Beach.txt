I you know but that's I don't but the thing I learned is that everybody has like their pro everybody
0:51
and granted that's a big one but some some problems you have to think about like that can
0:57

I just need to install the inverter or I need longer power cables so I can
3:10
run to the inverter wherever it is. of the cable. I need No, I need like nine
3:16
gauge [ __ ] giant fat cables and then I have to splice them on. Once I splice
3:22
those big giant cables on, I think I have everything I need, too.
3:27
It came with the cables so I could actually just extend the ones with those.
3:34
But they wanted to charge me $100 to extend the cables that radioactive. And I just really wanted the cables
3:40
extended. I just have to extend them myself. And I have to open up that little access area.
3:51
Look how perfectly clear this window is. I love a brand new window. Dude, it will
3:56

What about the wipers? Is that new or No. No. You got to [ __ ] change them. You will [ __ ] the windshield. Change them. This
4:10
came from a very very very very like frugal and fitious
4:17
individual who was an Army Corps of Engineer senior officer before he retired from Wisconsin. And this truck
4:26
was maintained lovingly and perfectly, every little detail.
4:36
What an [ __ ] like these people like they don't see my turn signal. He literally drives up on
4:42
me in a merge lane with me running out of room and he doesn't even see me at

That's pure THC you're inhaling. Like literally actually pure THC.
8:55
Anything that you blow out is wasted product.
9:03

9:10
to get every last bit of that [ __ ] in there. I'm going to get every last bit of it. I'm going to hold my breath. I'm
9:17
going to go Because anything you blow out is a
9:23
waste. Anything you see should be floating in your [ __ ] bloodstream being cannib in
9:31
your bloodstream is all I know. Anything about the beans,
9:36
huh? Do you know anything about the beans? Yeah, I guess they I don't I don't know. I mean, all I know is I I'm dependent on

12:46
I wrote this song, too. Which one? This one. I I wrote all these songs. I
12:51
made all of them. Every one of these songs in this playlist. But this is I spent my nightc
13:00
in my heart. Every thought, every spark pull me to a moment where everything became clear. Be
13:09
careful what you wish for. They always said we're spinning like

15:00
where the melodies blow, a story of love only we'll ever know.
15:07
So be careful what you wish for. They say, but I wish for you every single

15:18
everything right.

27:41
She's kind of sexy in a I said that chick's kind of sexy. She's
27:47
a little bit hosike. But she's kind of sexy.

28:40
No. How you [ __ ] forgive him? Because if somebody isn't your girlfriend, that
28:46
means you you mean nothing to him. [ __ ] him. No, I know who he is. and I kept his
28:53
secret even when his girlfriend was there and I didn't like
28:59
I didn't spill the beans when he like when he's hanging out with his
29:05
girlfriend. I didn't say, "Oh, you sent a dickpick to my girlfriend and then I

29:40
mean you mean nothing to me. You don't respect him. I can step on him if I wanted to. Why
29:45
would I beat his ass? And the other point is is that this is the first and
29:51
only girl in the universe I ever met that I know would never cheat on me just
29:56
like I would never cheat on her because we're twin flames. I mean, we are soul
30:01
flames. Check this closely. Tyler and I are twin flames. I mean, and
30:07
like our entire lives, we were right around each other. I was put into her life for her. I am her guardian.
30:17
I mean, that's the reality. I am Tyler's [ __ ] guardian angel. I know. Cuz you've been a long time ago.
30:23
I paid here's a little thing, and I don't mean any harm to her, but she had
30:29
a lot of issues with her dental health, right? And her teeth, for whatever reason,
30:38
she lost most of them. I paid $8,500
30:43
for the very best set. Why the [ __ ] ticket to uh Turkey and fix it at least
30:49
for like two grand, three grand, fix everything. I enjoy the time there. You can travel
30:55

31:02
she was found dead without her organs because they harvested her organs and
31:07
killed her. No.
31:13
Take it to Columbia, Mexico. No [ __ ] That's where they harvest or [ __ ]
31:19
expensive electricity. [ __ ] so expensive, man. One day, one of my tooth was loose and I
31:27
asked him to glue them together. He charged me like $500 to glue just to
31:32

32:19
but I left because I couldn't stand her, bro. I don't if women have need understanding
32:28
though. But I mean, you don't have to. You be you. I'm just saying for me and Tyler.
32:36
I I just know that I was put she's a good girl to protect
32:43
her. She's having anger problem and she want to fight and but she's a good girl at
32:49
the end. So she have one problem but have [ __ ] 10 problems, man.
32:56
No, I and she she I wish for Tyler and and I know I wish for her and every day I thank God for
33:03
her and I there is nothing that I would change about it. I love Erica, but Erica is giving all
33:09
empty promises. Everything empty. Everything is lying. So because that was Santa,
33:15
but you can't expect her to change one bit. I'm just saying when you meet somebody,
33:22
you cannot expect them. But the the drinking thing, but I mean, no matter what, you're doing what you need to do.
33:29
And I respect it. I'm not I'm just saying
33:34
you're living your life. The main thing that I'm hoping to convey to you is that your life is a life worth well lived
33:43
that you can love yourself and respect yourself.

34:10
the world the hottest one. No, I just want a soulmate. Somebody live with me
34:16
and we be care about each other. That's it. I don't want anything extreme. And I and I thank God every moment I found
34:22
her. I don't want the [ __ ] hot chick that everybody want her and I she have a
34:28
[ __ ] ego problem and she feel herself that she's better than anyone and have to I have to bust my ass to make her
34:35
like feel she's happy with me. No, I don't want a [ __ ] chick. But I like a chick where I have to work
34:41
for him like my fifth element. You don't have to work with anybody. If somebody loves you, they will stay with
34:47
you at any other [ __ ] It's not that for me. It's not that it's a matter of service,
34:55
but it's also attraction and what I'm attracted to and I'm attracted to
35:00
certain things. And when I'm attracted to it and like when I get that,
35:05
it's a very I mean it's a really physical high
35:10
like high like better than the greatest heroin dose in
35:17
the universe. Like heroin can't touch her. I mean, I
35:22
haven't done heroin, but you I've not done it, but I'm just saying. Me, too. I never never touch this thing.

35:42
Erica, it was in a mess. It was [ __ ] Tyler found a bag of meth that big that
35:49
was probably like a at least an eightball. An eightball of meth
35:55
and we threw it away. I threw it away. Do you like it? Did you like the mess or not?
36:00
I loved it. You loved it. I will not do it again though. Yeah. No, I know when you're not doing
36:07
you like it. Yeah. I won't do anything like and and Tyler wants me is like always offering
36:14
me her thing and I'm like there's no way I'll do it because the second you do it
36:20
then you're hooked and I don't ever want to be hooked again except a slurpie.
36:26
Oh, he's bad. [ __ ] destroy your life. Make you [ __ ] hit the ground
36:31
underground. This thing is bad.
36:37
I don't want to do any hard dogs in the last but meth I did meth and I did one Roxy
36:42
one time one time I did a half a Roxy a half a 50 mgram
36:50
Roxy that was crushed up on some aluminum foil and I hed I shoved it I
36:57
heated it up and it evaporated and I went and it was the speed
37:03
holy [ __ ] I did that with Amy Beth Ellison.
37:11
Bless her soul, wherever she is. Hopefully, she's healed from all of that
37:17
trauma she had experienced. But she inflicted a lot of trauma on me. I'll tell you what,
37:27
I was madly in love with this chick I met at the skating rink and she was so pretty.
37:33
like next level pretty and she just had the gift of dab like you would not believe. Like
37:39
she just funny as [ __ ] right? But she she could tease anybody.
37:45
Like you know she could like pick apart anybody or anything and that was her gift
37:52
was teasing and picking apart.
37:58
Your pig is about right. We need to get him checked. That big is [ __ ] up.
38:09
I tried to go very lightly on him. You going to go to the beach?
38:15
We were just driving around. Yeah. Okay. So, I want to [ __ ] eat something. Anything around? Well, no. I
38:23
I see. I think we're just taking a long way.
38:28
I'm not going to eat food.
38:36
Move that, please. Thank you. You can put it in the side thing or I'll put it in the side thing. The side thing is
38:42
busy.
38:47
Yeah. I'm hoping the brakes stay good enough. I mean, he said that they were just changed out. It's not good.
38:53
I'm pretty sure. Don't drive the car at all. Don't drive at all. I'll inspect it when we get back.
39:02
because just they're good. But yeah, but that's heavy van heavy old
39:07
van. So any problem going to happen is we're going to [ __ ] stuck in the street. It's not like Canada to survive. I mean
39:14
we all know this public stop not from a break issue.
39:23
I'm just saying
39:28
the Cadillac had worn through brake shoes. Like literally worn through when I got it.
39:45
Guess I never
39:52
Can you stop by any uh Publix? There's a Publix. Yeah, I want to go Publix.
39:58
But the Publix is on the way back. It's kind of a but yes,
40:16
but what we're doing right now I said what we are doing right now
40:24
is a ritualistic survey of our domain. We should go to
40:30
the [ __ ] beach, me and you. We are going to right now. No, no, no. We should get swimming days and go to the beach. Spend the day by
40:35
the by the beach. Get your speaker and we go there even without dogs. I don't care.
40:42
We can do that. We can take the dogs if you want in.
40:47
Yeah, we can do that today probably.
40:52
Change the view. Change your team.
40:58
And if dialer doesn't want to go, huh? Yeah, we'll go to the live happy every day, bro. Never no
41:04
matter what the partnership you want to leave, living life. Enjoy every [ __ ] day. I do enjoy every day.
41:10
You have? I do enjoy every day.
41:22
But yeah, we could drop the dogs off.
41:28
cuz Tyler definitely will not go.
41:33
She's on medication. Huh? She's on medication.
41:39
Chronic. She's on medication. Yeah. I need
41:46
Oh, the mental health is the worst thing ever. Like she's dealing with dealing with
41:52
she's dealing with a lot. I because I used to have a mental problem or two. When I get from alcohol, it's something
41:59
bad. You feel depressed. You want you want to be isolated. You don't want to go out.
42:05
You don't want to see people. You don't want to talk to anyone. Exactly. I was feeling the same feeling, man.
42:14
I stayed in my bedroom in the dark for 6 years closing the
42:20
blinds. But he used to see me when I get sober. But when I'm drunk, I'm always
42:26
closing my blinds, sitting in the dark in my room, drinking, nothing else. Waking up, sleeping,
42:31
drinking. After 10 days, I have to go to the ER put and soma,
42:41
even pain.
42:47
I've been fortunate enough not to have that. I've lived in confinement for 6
42:52
months of my life. I lived in a jail cell. Single man jail cell or twoman
42:58
jail cells. Huh? For 6 months of my life, I've spent
43:04
well I mean essentially if you're in a twoman cell, you're in maximum security.
43:10
I know if they knock you down and certain time cannot go out. That's
43:16
and you don't go out and literally you don't leave the cell but once a week to go take a shower. You get a shower week
43:23
a week. Once a week shower once a week. Shut the [ __ ] up. No, I'm not lying.
43:30
Take a shower twice, three times a day. Once a week,
43:35
they give you clothes to two times a week.
43:41
Once a week. I do anything to get in my life again.
43:51
do anything. Don't put it again. Okay. Who said I want to drink?
44:03
I really want to go to this church in Clearwater. Church of the Ascension because they
44:08
have a classic pipe organ. Dude, I'm serious. There's so much spirit. Like,
44:13
we are literally in the panel land of our reality. meaning there is there is
44:20
no real anything. We're all in a projection. And I know it's so hard to
44:26
wrap your head around that all this [ __ ] is a computerenerated [ __ ] reality.
44:33
It's a very advanced computer, but it's a computer nonetheless,
44:42
and it's non-deterministic. Well, it's deterministic, but
44:48
It's unfolding and we collectively determine how it
44:53
unfolds.
45:16
That's my favorite. My favorite
45:22
thing is
45:42
I like this song.
45:56
want to take it right down. I really want to know why you just
46:23
I'm just going to tell her we're going to the beach. Do you want to go or not?
46:29
We're leading the dogs here though.
46:36
You want to come take the dogs? Okay. It's fun for them, huh? It's fun for them. If you want to take
46:41
the dog and we can give them a bath after a bath by the beach. Yeah, but we have to put them on leashes
46:47
or No, no, no.
46:55
Yeah, but you have they can't go off police. They're not allowed to go off policemen. Nobody complain.
47:03
Most people say Well, they still have park rangers that go around and [ __ ] with you.
47:17
all the time. I guess the only thing I my first wife, the one thing I loved about my first
47:24
wife, she liked chicks, too. She was tricexual
47:30
and we she could we could like
47:35
and she would let me do her friend. So, she had a friend from the gas
47:41
station named Christina. And Christina was like 5'10 or 11.
47:48
She would have something. Well, Christina was 5' 10 and weighed
47:53
about 110 lbs and she was a Latina girl, but she had blonde hair. Pretty much she
48:00
looked exactly like Tyler, right? Like she was Tyler's twin, but like on Tyler
48:07
is pretty, but she need she's pretty. She have a pretty face.
48:15
I have no control over her. I feed her everything I can. Huh? I try to give her the best possible food to shape it for
48:22
her. That's why I got that in there for her.
48:37
But yeah, I do need to go swimming today. I want to go down to the beach, sit by the star, and get jumped feeling
48:44
happy and the flash. But I don't I want to go down to like IRB or one of these
48:49
spots anywhere. Anywhere you want. I don't care. Right.
48:54
But we can't take the dogs with us. Sit to the spots. we can and just sit as
49:01
close as we can, but we can I get to get this [ __ ] back for today. So, I
49:06
don't want to laugh again, so I can't keep him. I just want to go down to the beach and walk and and honestly, I'd
49:12
rather walk with you then cuz we can holler at, you know, not like I'm going to pick up any girl or anything, but
49:19
I would like you. Bro, I mean I
49:29
I will come take it. Not every girl. I want to pick it up. Doesn't mean I want to [ __ ] her. I want
49:35
to be her boyfriend. No. Just say hello. Be in their presence. Yeah. No, I have sense without any
49:41
benefit. I I I get happy just being in the presence of a beautiful woman. I don't
49:47
need to have sex with a beautiful woman. The presence of the woman right
49:53
makes you happy. Exactly. Even if you're not [ __ ] hairy, just I don't need this guy. I have
49:59
I have my woman. I will not ever. And I'm saying that for her.
50:05
Friendship with a girl is better than friendship with a guy. Those are good. And I had and I've always had good
50:11
friend female friends. Many good female friends.
50:28
Somebody. My hand

I don't want to lose your love tonight.
1:06:03
I don't

1:06:34
All right, good evening everyone. We're coming at you from
1:06:41
Agents Hangout, otherwise known as Fifth Elements Lair and this is the consort to
1:06:48
fifth element and fifth element herself. Anyhow, um I was going through today's
1:06:55
uh videos here and so I was going to curate my day
1:07:02
uh and I wanted to start with last night as it were because it's really cool. So,
1:07:08
I've got this up here. Um
1:07:15
and this was last night and I think and uh we're going to
1:07:20
pull that up and I'm going to mute my mic here and then hopefully unmute it once I get to the end of this here.
1:07:59
15 minutes.
1:08:14
Wow.
1:08:26
Heat. Heat.
1:08:54
Heat.
1:09:35
Heat. Heat.
1:09:51
Heat. Heat.
1:10:23
Sorry, bro. No, no problem, man. I'm not in a hurry. The only thing I got to do, I mean, I
1:10:29
kind of really get excited about actually going to the beach and walking up and down the beach and actually going
1:10:35
swimming like I did with my brother when we were kids. What do you got? I'm good, thanks. I'm good. I'm really
1:10:41
good right now. Yeah, we'll go cruising real quick. But I want to go swimming. I I Well,
1:10:49
go. I know. I know she won't. I Well, I'm pretty sure she'll be okay
1:10:55
with it. We're just going down. I'm not going to That's good.
1:11:00
You know, I have to Okay with my boss lady. I'm good. Thank
1:11:15
you. Jesus died. Pilates. Come on little buddy.
1:11:21
Yseph was Jesus. That's right. Come on, granddaddy. What the hell?
1:11:29
Come on, Grandpa.
1:11:40
What a wonderful baby. So, but I record this stuff, you know,
1:11:47
because I just Well, you don't know, but the reason why I record it is because
1:11:54
I watch a lot of old footage from antique times, you know, and what I'm
1:12:01
looking for is authentic, like what was life like then, right? And you look at the footage
1:12:08
and it's like and what I'm trying to build is an authentic accounting of my
1:12:14
life and is, you know, of my favorite things and all of that. And so by
1:12:20
bringing by doing this, what I'm actually doing is I'm not just bringing
1:12:25
you, but I'm bringing future people along with me that will never get the
1:12:32
opportunity to experience Clearwater in 2025. and with a med and five dogs. You
1:12:39
get what I'm saying? Like we have a unique experience. Yeah, we do.
1:12:44
And it's fun and but more importantly, there are so many people that don't have
1:12:50
any quality of life that are sitting in their house for 6 years or whatever and
1:12:55
they're depressed and if they happen along my channel when we when we get old, we will sit in
1:13:01
the house anyway. So, we don't have to rush it. We have to go out. But what I'm trying to do is preserve and document as
1:13:08
many of these great memories as possible. So when I am an invalid and I
1:13:14
do not have the ability to propel myself out of the house and into the soul van
1:13:20
and down to Clearwater that I'll be able to pull this up and remember these
1:13:25
occasions just like it was yesterday. You know what I'm saying? That's a very special thing.
1:13:32
Come on. I am actually
1:13:40
but but that's the reason why I make it.
1:13:47
I'm working tomorrow. Where are you working with your company? The the other one. Yeah. They didn't
1:13:53
call me by the way. Thursday. They also have daily pay available. Huh? Daily pay. Daily pay.
1:13:59
You can get daily pay for like $5 or something. So, like you can get paid every day in advance.
1:14:06
What the That's what's up, bro. Yeah, that's that's true. I'm pretty sure
1:14:12
I didn't pay every two [ __ ] weeks.
1:14:24
I'm going to a job interview in Tampa Monday for a political polling company. Like 14 to 16 bucks an hour.
1:14:33
more. Make money every day. Better than nothing. If you're making $50 every day,
1:14:39
it's better you're not making anything. Tyler deleted all my [ __ ] text out of
1:14:46
my phone. Why? And then I ask her why and she's like, I didn't do it. I'm
1:14:52
like, I know damn well she did it. It's [ __ ] mean as [ __ ] She does some really ratchet [ __ ] [ __ ]
1:15:01
But when she deletes my text out, I'm like, that's like revolting on a whole another
1:15:07
level. And then she goes, "Yeah,
1:15:12
it's very frustrating." And I really really Yeah.
1:15:30
But the deletion of my [ __ ] text threads, that's like
1:15:36
she has no boundaries at all. But we don't have any boundaries hardly. She's just she was just never hit as a child.
1:15:45
Not one single time. She was never punished ever. spoil
1:15:55
it. She was the most spoiled rotten child in the history of the universe.
1:16:10
But deleting my [ __ ] text threads, man. Right? Because I had information in
1:16:15
that about my job interview on Monday, which is now [ __ ] lost because I rely
1:16:21
on being able to save my [ __ ] text that she goes through and deletes and then lies about.
1:16:27
Huh? No, I'm going to call her on Monday and say that my girlfriend is crazy and
1:16:34
deleted my [ __ ] text thread. Sorry. I'll just say I lost the thread. I need
1:16:41
the address again. But that's real [ __ ] I mean, she literally did that in the
1:16:48
last three days, two days, because I had that note in on
1:16:53
Friday and when I went back to look for it, I'm like, where the [ __ ] is it? She literally deleted all of my [ __ ]
1:17:00
texts. She's a [ __ ]
1:17:06
But I can't do anything about it because she's my baby sister.
1:17:11
You get it? I just have to suffer with [ __ ] being tortured by the three [ __ ] muses
1:17:20
because I I Yeah,
1:17:27
it's all part of the act of this particular play that we're living.
1:17:40
Oh my god.

1:34:49
on. island. Honeymoon Island. Why?
1:34:55
Anywhere in any beach. It is better because there's no rocks

1:35:06
That's a thing.
1:35:20
I'm tempted to U-turn here, but I won't.

1:37:02
That's ancient concrete. Those rocks are ancient geopolymers concrete.
1:37:09
Those things Can we get to the dog thing here? Do you think? I think we can.
1:37:22
Those are all ancient geopolymer [ __ ] Like I'm thinking this whole island used
1:37:27

1:37:38
I need to get a beach card. uh beach buggy cart thingy.
1:37:46

1:38:58
or 30 years old and they start having [ __ ] mental problem start getting crazy judging you by the
1:39:06
her experience with the guys right no and I know that but I just accept that that's just part for the
1:39:12
course with my sister and that I know that I put myself like literally
1:39:17
actually like my life was designed so that I would be exactly where I needed
1:39:22
to be when T when she needed me. Like literally God put me like our lives has
1:39:30
intersected our entire life. Like she was born in Indiana, dude. What are the
1:39:35
odds that like her family moves down and when she's a little girl, I've skate by
1:39:41
her several times a week on the trail within a 100 ft of where she lives.
1:39:48
I'm not lying, dude. I'm telling you that we have been like we are soul flames and she worked her one of her
1:39:56
first jobs was working at Simpson Smorgesport Simpson Smorgesborg in Hudson or Newport
1:40:03
Richie whatever this restaurant was literally like my favorite childhood
1:40:11
experience with my grandparents or like it was up there one of the most
1:40:16
specialist things that we did together on Sundays or on Saturdays was to get
1:40:22
dressed up and drive to Listen, we would get dressed up and drive to Simpson
1:40:29
Smorgesport and it has been since burned down, but this was our like she worked
1:40:37
at my childhood special memory place. She grew up doing the same things that I
1:40:43
did. Don't you get it? No. Like what are the odds?
1:40:49
We lived within miles of each other and then when she was she was in a bad
1:40:54
relationship and you can let him out. I'll get out. I just need to find my um give me the vape.
1:41:00
Sorry. You're like, "Give me the damn babe." Yeah, it's not mine. It's Erica.
1:41:05
She would cry if I pitched to her. And she don't smoke weed. I don't know why.
1:41:11
That is so No, that finally is working. You like it? Oh, I love it.
1:41:16
I love it. Finally. That's the reason why I started getting
1:41:22
wisful. I was like, "Wow."
1:41:31
Uh, we'll find him.
1:41:40
He's right here. This one
1:41:56
2 without
1:43:11
Huh? You was I No, I'm not. I'm No. When you when you get corrected.
1:43:16
No, I was completely the Daisy. Stop it. I was completely normal. I was just
1:43:21
pissed off at my gay [ __ ] neighbors that were being [ __ ] and and I had been
1:43:27
assaulted by my neighbor. The guy was a pimp. When David Rosen assaulted me with a
1:43:33
knife, it made me manic because I realized I was bulletproof.
1:43:38
And like that realization, I've been in so many like
1:43:44
life-threatening situations where I not only survived miraculously, but didn't
1:43:50
get any injury at all. I was in a 55 mph
1:43:56
drive off the side of a mountain accident which hit a tree going 55 m an
1:44:03
hour. The car got wrapped around it. There was nothing left of the front of that car. Nothing left out of the front
1:44:11
of that car. I had no injuries at all. The only injury I sustained
1:44:20
was I pooped my pants. I did not even get a scratch.
1:44:25
Not one scratch in that accident, dude. Like, I was miraculously saved.
1:44:32
Miraculously. But I've been in so many fights where
1:44:37
like literally hands were broken on my head. Do you get
1:44:43
what I'm saying? It's like I have been protected by a divine
1:44:49
like divine protection. I have I'm not lying.
1:44:54
And I And then when I say I've been in probably 20 fights in my life. How many fights
1:45:00
have you been in? Oh, I can't I couldn't count. I can't remember. In prison, I was in eight fights in
1:45:07
prison. I fought a lot of them in jail and I got my ass beat in most of them.
1:45:13
We're leaving now when the guy is coming. But the main thing is is every single one knows that I don't take I will fight
1:45:22
and I'm not going to big dude. I'm not going to lay down.
1:45:28
Yeah. No. Well, some people don't understand that.
1:45:36
And so, every so often you have to fight and establish your boundaries again.
1:45:42
That's true. And but
1:45:47
this one guy, I earned his respect and he got out of
1:45:53
prison two months ago and I can find him and
1:45:59
hope get him back on his feet if he hasn't already. He's been exonerated after
1:46:05
being in prison for like 25 years.
1:46:15
What's that? Gas. Gas powered one. I never seen that before.
1:46:22
Well, if you can have an electric powered one, you can have a gas powered one. Why not?
1:46:31
I think the guys will be will have more problems than electric one. Oh yeah. Well, the electric one has one
1:46:37
moving part, right? The motor. It spins. That's it.
1:46:42
Yeah. A lot of those mo electric motors only literally they're a hub mounted electric
1:46:47
motor. There's one moving part. I love that right there. I want I want one of those. The camper.
1:46:53
Yeah. But it doesn't have room like Well, yeah, but I mean, if all you're
1:46:58
doing is sleeping in there and you're hanging out during the day when it's hot and you just need a place to chill on
1:47:04
the couch or whatever and you're I would think about about a big one
1:47:11
bigger than that like with a bedroom and a bathroom in the back.
1:47:17
You never get it. Never get out. Okay.
1:47:37
Yeah, but we can drop the dogs off and come back. It goes swim.
1:47:43
I'm down with that.
1:47:48
We got
1:47:59
forever
1:48:11
days of my life.
1:48:25
Best days of my life.
1:48:41
Hi. Where are you? I'm on the bridge in front of San Key

1:49:50
I love you. Sort of. Mostly, actually, I didn't.
1:49:58
You messed up my music.
1:50:31

1:53:15
Hey, babe. So, now Tekken isn't working yet again. I'll fix it when I arrive home. Love, I
1:53:23

1:54:18
not funny. I will fix it when I get home. I know. I know.
1:54:24
Just don't change the camera. As long as you sign it back in and leave the camera on, it'll run indefinitely pretty much.
1:54:29
And you can use the same account. Don't do anything to it. Okay. Just sign it in. If if it's not connected, that's the reason why. But I
1:54:36

1:56:08
Are you okay? Are you okay? Every
1:56:27
I guess
1:56:33
the bathroom was
1:56:40
You been
1:57:04
kind of close.
1:57:21
I guess you know the
1:57:35
Heat. Heat.
1:58:10
Police ahead. Is it okay if I bark at him just like once?
1:58:20
Heat. Heat. N.
1:58:31
I love you.
1:58:53
Heat. Heat. N.
1:59:16
Where are you?
1:59:39
are you
1:59:47
know you are you
1:59:57
Easy.
2:00:18
No matter how hard I try, you keep pushing me and I can't
2:00:29
pick up. So sad to be here.
2:00:40
I said you're going to be the lonely one. Oh,
2:00:46
do you believe?
2:00:59
Yes, love. Can't you stop at Walmart on your way down to the house or whatever and grab
2:01:04
like soda or something too? It would be my pleasure, my princess.
2:01:11
You don't have to, but we can make some. But absolutely, love. I would be I would
2:01:17
I would be so inclined as to Oh, yeah. Okay.
2:01:27
I love her. I love her. Bro, she's all I wish for. And and honestly,
2:01:33
there is no other female form that could possibly make me
2:01:38
as happy. And I will not violate her trust or
2:01:45
anything else because I am the end of a whole bunch of soul contracts that needed fulfillment.
2:01:54
in previous lives who lives were cut short and I was robbed of the benefit of
2:02:00
my little sister's or baby daughter and all of those are contained within my
2:02:06
fifth element for Go.
2:02:27
Go smoke in the morning again. Huh? Smoking in the morning makes you [ __ ] tired.
2:02:33
I'm not tired at all. Tired.
2:02:45
You can fix the AC, huh? Can you fix the AC? Well, it's cool, isn't it? Yeah. Can you fix it?
2:02:51
It was never broken. So, what's happened? I had it on low instead of high. Oh,
2:02:56
I put it on high a while back.
2:03:06
M
2:03:12
living life.
2:03:20
I really don't think you're strong enough.
2:03:30
I feel I really want to make a story.
2:03:38
Do you believe
2:03:44
I can feel something inside? I really don't think you're strong
2:03:50
enough. Do you believe
2:03:57
I can feel I really don't think you're strong
2:04:04
enough.
2:04:23
How soon can I get more money? I need something sooner than that for by
2:04:30
the view. 21st. No, I'm just saying I got 300. I give you almost half the
2:04:37
300. How much you How much you going to charge me? Well, and considering that it's only
2:04:43
part of that the month, how much you going to charge for the college?
2:04:49
Well, I I think fair right now is like just for short term and without anything, it's like 5 500 and then
2:04:58
incidentals, but I need as much as I can get and I know that I can give you 100 today.
2:05:04
So, but with that, I owe you another 100 for the end of the month. Not the end of the month. And I
2:05:10
and I can pay you back, too. I just need a loan. I I would even do it that way.
2:05:16
I'm just I just have a car insurance payment that's coming up, which I think will kill my credit card. I'm going to
2:05:23
try to put it onto my credit card. And if I can't No,
2:05:28
I'm Listen, you left my bag. I got your back. So, I'm going to try to put that on my credit card before I have to I
2:05:35
don't have an automatic payment, but it's due by the 21st separately. I have
2:05:42
a power bill that is going that has it's normalized and there's a $220 power
2:05:48
bill. Give you 100 today, right? Tomorrow I get paid. I give you 100 after tomorrow I get paid. I give you
2:05:53
100 and that's and then we're good. Okay. And I'm not And like I said, I love you, bro. And I respect you.
2:06:00
everything you told me. Now, when I leave, well, either way, I'm going to probably leave on Monday and
2:06:08
drive this vehicle tomorrow night after I get done with my appointment. My plan
2:06:14
right now is probably to drive to my brother's house in this
2:06:20
bed. Huh? The bed? No. No. This van will make it easily.
2:06:28
I take the can. Huh? I will take the can if I'm new place
2:06:33
faster and easier. Huh? Faster and easier. It's not going to drink gas from the wrong distance. And
2:06:40
at the meantime, it's not going to break down from you. This thing can break down from you in the middle of the nowhere.
2:06:48
Unless you're going to go fix the brakes and check the the car. Why you didn't go to the guy?
2:06:53
Huh? Why didn't you go to the guy that he gave us a think mechanic?
2:07:00
Why didn't I go to the mechanic? Yeah, I check the brakes, check the suspension, check the No, I know this. I know. Because the guy
2:07:07
I bought it from, dude, I'm telling you. But this truck was like literally handd
2:07:13
delivered to me to become the USS Enterprise. It doesn't need brakes. Yes.
2:07:20
I know it sounds like it, but it doesn't necessarily need brakes.
2:07:26
Uh, I'm pretty sure that the brakes are good.
2:07:33
Let's throw the guy. It's got 233,000 miles on it. It's got more than that.
2:07:40
It's got 240,513
2:07:47
240,000 miles. But it was in a fleet and it was
2:07:53
maintained in a fleet for most of that. So this was a limousine and a limousine fleet.
2:08:02
Airport limo and practice limo.
2:08:32
But that is a good consideration. The Cadillac does get a little bit better gas mileage.
2:08:38
Nice moves and fast.
2:08:44
How many? Uh, and my brother already has an RV and camper and everything else that we would
2:08:49
need. There we go. We're going to freaking enjoy. We didn't need it.
2:08:55
How many hours you driving? It's 12. There's no big deal. You don't need that [ __ ] Just drive
2:09:02
a big deal. I can take a nap in the driver's seat anyway in the Cadillac.
2:09:08
Yeah, is a big deal. Yeah. Yeah, I mean, I've driven it in a Geo Storm five times.
2:09:16
I've driven it in just about every car I've ever owned. Five times. I drove from here
2:09:21
except for um Florida.
2:09:30
But this that's the whole reason why I bought this van is to do that trip. But if I don't
2:09:38
do the dog, huh? Snoop Dog Dog. You know, Snoop Dog.
2:09:44
Snoop Dogg. What? He looks like Snoop Dog. He does. All right.
2:09:52
I kind of want to go forward here. You can. Who can? But I'm going to have to like get around
2:09:58
that to get the 12pack in or whatever. We'll figure it out. Do you think soda?
2:10:06
Yeah. I'll get some soda. You look at the van, huh? Huh? Can lock it though.
2:10:11
Yeah, I'm going to lock it. Okay. I'm going to test it before I get out.
2:10:19
The key fob does work.
2:10:45
Enterprise departing.
2:11:19
Tell me. Huh? Tell me I don't for you.
2:11:28
I love going in the side entrance to my freaking little excursion cruiser.
2:11:36
I love this vehicle.
2:11:50
One more stop.
2:12:12
No, I know this car is reliable. Look at that. It's so [ __ ] sweet.
2:12:19
He's got that so nice. It is clean. It's like a 1987 888 89 90.
2:12:27
Oh, it looks [ __ ] perfect. Other than the fact they're missing the gas cap cover, but
2:12:35
that's old. I had a buddy that had one, but the LX that's an LX 5 L obviously.
2:12:41
Is that your D? No, it's a Mustang LX. You got the same engine. Ste.
2:12:47
Yeah. 5.
2:12:56
This [ __ ] drinking gas.
2:13:12
It's beautiful.
2:13:17
I love it.
2:14:06
Damn, dogs. Somebody farted.
2:14:11
Oh, it's a seaw definitely part.
2:14:34
Heat. Heat.
2:15:05
Now Met says the brakes are kind of bad on this.
2:15:10
I think they just have warp rotors mostly. But
2:15:15
is that I know that I still have plenty of uh brake pad on them. The guy I bought him
2:15:22
from is like I said he's a retired like at least lieutenant colonel probably
2:15:28
colonel from the ar ar ar ar ar ar ar ar ar ar ar ar ar ar ar ar ar ar ar ar army corps of engineers. He retired from Wisconsin. The guy was
2:15:34
like he and I have all the paperwork. He gave me all of it. He showed me all the maintenance history on this thing. He
2:15:41
drove it back and forth between here and and Wisconsin two or three times and it
2:15:48
just sat in his front and he bought a new like way nicer uh like brand new
2:15:56
like camper van thing that probably like 80 or 90 grand. Nice. But and I've got
2:16:02
pictures of it. So they never drove this solo van anymore except for the
2:16:08
occasional store trip or something. and it was just taking up space and uh
2:16:15
and and so it's going to get gas real quick.
2:16:29
Is that all right? Huh? Do you have anything else to do? No. Okay.
2:16:34
Nothing to do. Huh? Nothing. I don't have anything. Except maybe go swimming. I still want
2:16:41
to do that. I hope so. I think so. I hope so. When we get wherever we're going, it'll
2:16:46
be later and we can just go like walk down and Oh, okay. like 4 5:00 I'll wear I'll wear a bathing suit
2:16:53
straight away and then we do this jump in the water and we can forget the
2:16:59
electronic devices and everything and uh
2:17:08
all right I got to make a turn here some I'd rather avoid I mean I really want to
2:17:13
go in there but I just don't feel like taking the time.
2:17:19
Um, interesting intersection.
2:17:33
Eh, I might decide to come back later. I guess it's [ __ ] packed.
2:17:39
It's always packed. But yeah, we can come I guess I can come back in the morning on this one. definitely come
2:17:46
back in the morning. Good job, guys. Yeah, I just wanted to top it off, but
2:17:54
I'm going to just go around this way here.
2:18:03
All right. A lot of people waiting in line at the Sam Club.
2:18:26
Oh wow, this is playing off the phone while this is recording.
2:18:32
That is cool.
2:18:37
Heat.
2:18:49
Heat.
2:18:58
Heat. Heat.
2:19:20
Heat.
2:19:40
Heat.
2:19:45
Heat. Heat.
2:20:30
They're all happy. They're all going to the park two times.
2:20:36
Huh? They're happy as [ __ ] Huh? I said they're happy as [ __ ]
2:20:42
Yeah, of course. I love the the park because the dogs.
2:20:47
Well, yeah, but I mean their their spiritual energy infuses us with happiness when they go to a place like
2:20:53
that. Yes, that's true. I'm pretty sure of it. like I'm happy
2:20:58
because they're happy and like their happiness is transferring to me and their joy and it's it's joy which is
2:21:05
different than peace. I feel joy when I go to the park and I'm surrounded by
2:21:11
nature and just all of that, you know,
2:21:20
intentional energy that we are transmitting and
2:21:25
sending forth. Ah, thank you, man. Pleasure. Let's figure out what's up.
2:21:32
Let's go. Right.
2:21:38
See what the fifth element is going on.
2:21:44
And what's that? Okay.
2:21:53
You can let him out. Of course, Max.
2:22:06
I have to come back there real quick, but I'll be there in a second. Wouldn't get, you know, I'm going to be
2:22:12
a good driver.
2:22:29
in your bedroom.
2:22:41
But if we go to Honeymoon Beach, I do have the card.
2:22:46
Doesn't matter. Huh? No. Well, it's free parking there. It doesn't matter because it's far far away from here.
2:22:52
Huh? Far. Which is the What's the closest beach to here? Because it's it's clear water.
2:22:57
It's full crop. Just go through some chicks from there, bro. That's the main reason why I wanted
2:23:03
to see many many chicks. [ __ ] sorry.
2:23:08
[ __ ] I want to [ __ ] Huh? I want to kill the girl, bro.
2:23:14
Look at the girl is a big mad girl.
2:23:28
Hey,

It's a nice day. What would I say?
2:24:27
Please don't cry anymore.
2:24:38
Better job. Yeah, I did.
2:24:43
And King give me job day too. He sent me some jobs like part part time
2:24:49
but in the bush garden forward forward.
2:24:59
No are clean but you don't need sand.
2:25:08
Yeah. Okay.
2:25:33
I want something.
2:25:39
Huh? Yo, do you want to come with us?
2:25:45
Yeah, we left already. Where we going, Ken?
2:25:52
Uh, I thought we'd just go down to like the north parking lot on Clear Water Beach.
2:25:59
The north one, like on the beach and wait for a parking spot to open the beach where
2:26:07
right on Clear Water. Like if you make a right on Mandalay Avenue and from the circle that go up to the north parking
2:26:14
lot next to the speedway and the fire station
2:26:19
behind the fire station.
2:26:43
But it would be awesome if she came out. That would really be us. But or whomever. Yeah.
2:26:52

2:26:57

2:27:21
get married. I know. Yeah. I mean I don't
2:27:26
He loves him and she loves him. Yeah.
2:27:31
She was literally designed for me by me. Most of them are kind of most of them.
2:27:42

2:29:13

2:29:42
Who's the trouble with who? Nobody can put that in trouble, bro.
2:29:51
How do you like the speed? Huh? How do you like the stuff? Oh, well, I mean, I have like a supreme
2:29:57
tolerance. I'm I'm pretty okay, but I was driving 37. Now I'm going the speed
2:30:02
limit. So, you feel it or not? Does that feel it? Actually,
2:30:08
it's good. Not bad. I think the turbines is a thing that makes you feel uh feel better. Not
2:30:16
teaching, but I feel amplified. I don't feel like
2:30:22
you get what I'm saying. I don't, you know, I'm more capable, not less capable.
2:30:29
You know what the best fe what why I love weed so much? Because it gives you the feeling sometimes. I don't give a
2:30:36
[ __ ] You know this feeling? Oh, yeah. Well, I haven't Because Because give me a feeling. I
2:30:42
don't give a [ __ ] No, I don't care about anything. I'm bulletproof. You see me? I'm bulletproof. I literally
2:30:48
know I'm bulletproof. But I have broken so many people have broken their hands on my head.
2:31:00
That is such a sexy car right there.
2:31:05
Ah man. Cadillac CT
2:31:11
5 CTS. What CTS? But it looks like a media
2:31:17
Facebook. Oh no way. She let her friend disrespect him.
2:31:22
I love that car and talk [ __ ] about him. But it looks too much like an him. And he's he saw he's seeing he's seeing
2:31:29
everything online. He's saying that he's been cursed. is think that he's been distracted. I don't
2:31:35
know how it's supposed that way. Huh? It's so your business.
2:31:43
No, stay away from me. It's not your business.
2:31:49
Okay, go. All right. Who is that? Her again?
2:31:56
Yeah. You guys are codependent. Our neighbor is fighting. Huh? Our neighbor next door,
2:32:02
right? They are fighting together. This a dude and a girl. He's doing masks and she's
2:32:09
doing cradle. This is called cradle if you know about CH47 or whatever the opium stuff.
2:32:16
All of the old days they [ __ ] up. They didn't pay the rent. They would get evicted and they beating the others in
2:32:22
the street and the motor block everywhere. That's sad.
2:32:27
And Erica is nosy. She want to get invol get herself involved in this situation. Why the [ __ ] I get myself involved with
2:32:32
girlfriend and her boyfriend? Why get between them? Right.
2:32:41
I love this. just just I just remember I'll kill you. [ __ ] Right. After Lori
2:32:48
and I broke up, she called me over one time and her friend and her I ended up
2:32:54
essentially [ __ ] her, but having group sex with her and her friend,
2:33:00
my ex Lori, but it was really hot and I could have
2:33:05
[ __ ] her friend, but I just was so fat and out of shape that I just was embarrassed to be quite honest.
2:33:13
Yeah. But now, if I had the opportunity, it would be an entirely separate
2:33:19
situation. I can assure you of that. She was so hot, too. Fake boobs. I mean,
2:33:24
Lory's friend boobs, huh? No, just occasionally,
2:33:30
but she was built for it. It was just a fun experience. No hard feelings. I just
2:33:35
wish I would have tapped it a little bit more. Anyway, I was too nice to Lori.
2:33:44
And she was never nice to me, not once. Because he was nice to her. That's the
2:33:50
trick. Here is the trick of the girls. You being nice to her, she will be an [ __ ] to you. You be an [ __ ] to her
2:33:56
and mean, she will be very nice to you. All the girls like that, bro. Because she's thinking some some of them like
2:34:03
like when a girl get a rich get in relationship with a rich guy and he has a lot of money and he's spending money
2:34:09
on her she starts thinking like she's worth a lot more than him because of
2:34:14
that he's paying money to keep her with with him to keep him to get her right
2:34:19
that how he's thinking but that's not but like for me and Tyler that's not it at all like I mean and
2:34:26
that's the thing people don't get about my relationship with the fifth element,
2:34:33
right? Like it is literally divine and I know it. Tyler is a good person, but I have a
2:34:39
problem. No, I know she does. She has a problem. Is she a good person? But she's my soulmate and I know this
2:34:46
and and it's wonderful. And I know that she needs me and literally actually God
2:34:53
put me in her life. I put me there. But I saw it in my samati experience. But
2:35:00
like literally actually our lives intersected
2:35:06
so that I could be there for her. And if you look at her life and how she ended
2:35:11
up down here, it's the weirdest thing. It doesn't make any sense from Indiana
2:35:18
and then of all the places right there, right on the path. and she looks exactly
2:35:25
like I would draw my dream girl. I mean, I'm not lying to you. And so, I know
2:35:32
when I was in prison, I had a game that I played with myself, right? And it was
2:35:39
a I had a a game that I played with myself
2:35:45
called Time Machine. And uh and all time machine was
2:35:53
is is I would just lay there like this and I would just imagine when I would be with Tyler actually. And I've been with
2:36:01
her for 4 and 1/2 years. And she's she's got so many issues. But the reason why
2:36:07
is because she is actually like
2:36:13
my three muses. Like literally actually like I don't I mean I have to kiss her
2:36:18
three times. I've deeply examined this. Sometimes this way is not it's not going to work.
2:36:24
Huh? Sometimes if you been dry that will solve a problem makes you feel
2:36:30
comfortable there if you don't like show your love so much. Life will be much
2:36:36
more easier and she's not going to be like me to you. A girl is like that. Cuz
2:36:41
the girl keeps telling her I love you. You are the one. No, I just she start having an ego and
2:36:47
she started by me. She's being disgusted that she don't want you to girls that.
2:36:53
She didn't she never got it from anybody else cuz she was always attracted to
2:36:59
guys that treated her like dog [ __ ] and so or maybe not. I don't know. But I
2:37:05
know that. Okay. You see that? She was treated like dog [ __ ] in her
2:37:12
previous life. So why she's that getting angry when you're treating lies? Cuz she don't want
2:37:17
to be treated nice. Because she doesn't love herself yet. And so it's my job as an archangel or an
2:37:26
angel or just a lover and a friend and also her actual soulmate because I know
2:37:32
this, right? I know it. Oh, I know it. I know I'm her soulmate. And because she
2:37:39
has the souls of my unborn sisters and daughters dwelling within her. And I
2:37:47
know that, too. And you think I'm crazy, but I see things.
2:37:57
And I'm pretty sure that what I see is real. That's all I'm saying. And I know
2:38:04
that soul contracts are real. And I know that my unborn sisters and daughter were
2:38:11
robbed of their experience with either their big brother or daddy.
2:38:17
I know this because I know my family history. Island. Um yeah, it's beautiful out there.
2:38:24
It's so beautiful. And there is no island. We can charter a boat, dude. Like in a
2:38:30
month or two, we can charter a boat and take a boat and just go take a a whole
2:38:35
day in a boat charter for like $400 or $500 for a day. That's too bad.
2:38:40
For a half a day, but it's a big boat, bro. We can buy a boat. We don't want to buy a boat.
2:38:45
See, I can buy a boat. Don't want to buy a boat. You want to get a boat club membership?
2:38:52
Yeah, I know that. And we could get that with the house actually with if you stay
2:38:57
in there and we convert that front room into a proper room. We could we can get a house.
2:39:02
We could get Well, yeah, we just get a house. We I saw I can go I can share you with that. I
2:39:08
can go with you with you the house. I will split it and do business.
2:39:15
But we can keep we can keep Nick and Ken with us too.
2:39:20
Huh? as many rooms as possible so we can subdivide all the rooms out.
2:39:31
But yeah, I need to do that ASAP. Bro, I told you about the capsule homes, but
2:39:36
they didn't listen to me cuz I was planning to get a cheap land, like one acre for 50 grand and put like 10 of
2:39:45
those capsule houses and rent them out for 1,000 a month. You don't you didn't
2:39:50
see how [ __ ] nice is it? It's It's not cheap. It's 20 grand. The unit is 20 grand. So it's like if you're going to
2:39:58
get like 10 units, it's $200,000. No, $400,000.
2:40:04
But it's giving you a lot of money.
2:40:13
Yeah, I think these brakes need to be looked at.
2:40:19
Is it beautiful
2:40:26
where you are?
2:40:53
Oh,
2:41:03
sorry.
2:41:32
I am here.
2:41:46
You see that? Don't worry. You're always impress.
2:42:05
I guess we could park in the parking garage, but I'd rather not. Huh?
2:42:17
There's a parking garage right there. We're not going to park up at the beach.
2:42:27
Oh, yeah. The great hog.
2:42:36
We love old games. Never.
2:42:46
What's the end for today? I don't know why. Huh? Sunday. She'll be busy.
2:42:59
Stretch me down.
2:43:05
Thanks. I love it.
2:43:18
How does it work? You have to pay to get in. Have you been in there?
2:43:23
Where? in that place. Oh. Oh, you have to pick the game. Well, I guess it's more for like
2:43:29
families than for like single people. I'm going down. I just want to go down.
2:43:36
I was going to leave the phone in the car.
2:43:42
Yeah. Tie my just the ignition key.
2:43:49
Um, we're going to back up here.
2:44:04

2:46:19
Huh? I could use that little electric stick thing. Which electric stick? The the

2:50:46

2:59:45
Okay. What's
2:59:51

3:00:00
in the minivan in the van.
3:00:08
Oh, slow down. Slow down. You have to slow down here. Where's that? Let's slow down. Oh, poor.

This is so much fun.
3:02:17
Shoot up for the moon. Now the star.
3:02:46
Hi.
3:03:07
Damn, that is bad.
3:03:31
You know, 9 seconds.
3:03:51
Intensity fills the air.
3:03:56
Feel the ground tremble. Tremble in the echo of silence. Other voices
3:04:02
unite. Intensity fills the air.
3:04:11
Feel the growing. I must be our voices unite.
3:04:37
Wow. That way over there.
3:04:45
Let's get
3:05:00
it on the
3:05:16
Round
3:05:31
you feel me.
3:05:59
Speak this up.
3:06:30
I want I'm sorry. Do you want to call her back?
3:06:37
No. Do you want to call her back? No, it's fine. You're good. Yeah, I'm sorry. You just need to jam up.
3:06:42
She was just coming to that. She want to pick me up. I don't know why.
3:06:47
She want me to stay with you, right? She needs to get [ __ ]
3:06:53
right? No, she want to drive me to work and make me move. And she needs to get [ __ ]
3:07:02
Hey. Yeah. Look, baby.
3:07:10
Huh? Okay.
3:07:18
Okay. How much?
3:07:31
Okay. Hello brother. Hello Ken. How you doing? I am well thank you. And how are you
3:07:38
today? Pleasant. First thing is good. We went camping and um got home and then it
3:07:46
rained and I took a nap and I just woke up. Oh, okay.
3:07:51
Well, I are you going to be u
3:07:56
the message we got from you right now? I couldn't get messages was that um
3:08:03
you're thinking about coming up this next week. Well, what I was hoping was to leave tomorrow night perhaps and come up until
3:08:12
whenever and then we have to be back by Monday the following
3:08:18
no matter what. So, that's our like dead limit, but I can live off of my credit
3:08:25
card for gas and uh but essentially drive the
3:08:31
Cadillac up and hang out and then you get it.
3:08:38
Yeah. So, it would be the four of you? I don't know. I think it would just be Well, I mean it would be Tyler, myself,
3:08:45
and the dogs. Yeah, that's what I meant by the four of you. It'll be the five of us.
3:08:53
Five of you? Yeah, that's right. Max. Um,
3:08:58
yeah. I mean, so you'll be leaving tomorrow night and probably getting here
3:09:04
Tuesday night. Drive straight through, right?
3:09:09
Pretty much. Well, I'm I'm If you got here Tuesday evening, that would be
3:09:15
better because um I committed to doing a job this entire next week. I'm turning a
3:09:22
deck into a room. Well, I could even come along with you on that. I mean, I don't have a problem
3:09:28
with that. I guess you could. Could you But I mean, you could pay me as your helper or something. Or I could
3:09:34
just be your helper and you could help me with the trip and that would be fun, I think. And certainly a worthy
3:09:41
endeavor. Oh, I Yeah, I can consider that.
3:09:46
And plus, I'd probably learn a thing or two, which I might be able to translate into some form of trade down here. I
3:09:52
don't know. I'm just saying that I was so if that was what you were planning on but then like I have I would have to
3:10:01
leave like on Saturday to come back here is the thing you know
3:10:06
so I could be back and not the um not the van right
3:10:14
is the van just less reliable or what well it has a problem with braking
3:10:20
that's the main thing I would like to take the van. I mean, the van is awesome
3:10:25
and it's really roadw worthy and everything. And I'm going to be coming back up for homecoming weekend hopefully
3:10:32
October 17th. I really want to go up to RMA for my 30
3:10:37
35th homecoming. Nobody else from my class has registered to go back, but it
3:10:43
just really seems significant and I really wanted to go back and I can't even afford to pay for like the $80
3:10:51
business dinner function or anything. So,
3:11:00
well, yeah. I mean, if you would have cut Yeah. I guess it just you came out Monday night, you would be here
3:11:08
realistically by Tuesday, right?
3:11:14
Uh yeah, or Tuesday evening. So that way I could
3:11:19
work on on this um project Monday and Tuesday and then you get here Tuesday
3:11:24
evening and I could theoretically help you work
3:11:29
