# AI-Powered Video Clip Selection System - Angel OS Implementation

## üéØ Proposal Overview

I'm excited to propose implementing your RAG-powered video clip selection system using **Angel OS** - a comprehensive multi-tenant platform I've developed that's perfectly suited for this type of AI-powered workflow automation.

## üöÄ Why Angel OS is Perfect for Your Project

**Angel OS** ([Demo: https://spaces.kendev.co](https://spaces.kendev.co)) is a production-ready platform that includes:

- ‚úÖ **Built-in RAG capabilities** with vector search
- ‚úÖ **PostgreSQL + pgvector** already configured
- ‚úÖ **OpenAI integration** and embeddings pipeline
- ‚úÖ **n8n workflow automation** built-in
- ‚úÖ **Multi-tenant architecture** for scalability
- ‚úÖ **Real-time APIs** for seamless integration

**My Background:** I've been running [kendev.co](https://kendev.co) for 5+ years, specializing in AI automation and custom workflow solutions.

## üîß Technical Approach

### Phase 1: Vector Database & Indexing (Week 1)
- **Database Setup**: Leverage Angel OS's existing pgvector configuration
- **Clip Analysis Pipeline**: Ingest your Gemini-analyzed video library
- **Embedding Generation**: OpenAI embeddings for semantic search
- **Metadata Indexing**: Store clip metadata, timestamps, and analysis results

### Phase 2: RAG Search System (Week 2)
- **Semantic Search Engine**: Vector similarity matching with configurable thresholds
- **Fallback Logic**: Intelligent routing between library clips and generation
- **API Endpoints**: RESTful APIs for real-time clip matching
- **Performance Optimization**: Efficient querying and caching

### Phase 3: n8n Integration & Testing (Week 3)
- **Custom n8n Nodes**: Seamless integration with your existing workflow
- **Workflow Orchestration**: Connect clip selection to Creatomate pipeline
- **Testing Suite**: Comprehensive testing with sample scripts
- **Documentation**: Complete handover documentation
