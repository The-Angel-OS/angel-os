1
00:00:01,760 --> 00:00:03,920
Good afternoon, everyone. Today is

2
00:00:05,440 --> 00:00:08,200
August the 14th, 2025, and the

3
00:00:08,240 --> 00:00:09,760
time is currently

4
00:00:13,120 --> 00:00:16,000
54:47 p.m.

5
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:18,080
And, of course, I have my brightness set

6
00:00:18,160 --> 00:00:20,560
up way too high, so it makes it very

7
00:00:20,560 --> 00:00:23,280
difficult to see that here.

8
00:00:23,440 --> 00:00:26,001
Let's check that out. Ah, nice

9
00:00:26,001 --> 00:00:28,161
little clear water cruising.

10
00:00:29,521 --> 00:00:31,681
You get a good idea. Our temperature is

11
00:00:34,241 --> 00:00:37,201
87 degrees. Got outside. Beautiful day.

12
00:00:37,841 --> 00:00:40,641
We had an awesome adventure. I

13
00:00:40,641 --> 00:00:43,401
just made a little clip of myself

14
00:00:43,521 --> 00:00:46,201
making a fool of myself

15
00:00:46,561 --> 00:00:49,361
with my favorite song

16
00:00:50,401 --> 00:00:53,321
ever, Enterprise Dog Park,

17
00:00:53,321 --> 00:00:56,001
or a song about Enterprise Dog Park. So

18
00:00:56,001 --> 00:00:58,681
without further ado,

19
00:00:58,921 --> 00:01:01,481
Two, I'm going to start out with this

20
00:01:01,481 --> 00:01:03,401
song about Enterprise, a song about

21
00:01:03,401 --> 00:01:04,881
Enterprise Dog Park, but I'm not going to

22
00:01:04,881 --> 00:01:07,681
play it off of this right here, the this

23
00:01:07,681 --> 00:01:10,361
version. I'm going to play it off of the

24
00:01:10,361 --> 00:01:12,401
version that I just made for another one.

25
00:01:12,561 --> 00:01:14,241
Anyhow, let's try this out. So let's

26
00:01:14,241 --> 00:01:16,241
listen to it real quick and see how this

27
00:01:16,241 --> 00:01:18,122
goes. I just listened to this one myself

28
00:01:18,122 --> 00:01:20,842
and I. like, it's fun. But then I

29
00:01:20,842 --> 00:01:22,722
realized that most of the time when

30
00:01:22,722 --> 00:01:24,002
you're doing a recording, you're going to

31
00:01:24,002 --> 00:01:26,282
do multiple voice tracks, and honestly,

32
00:01:26,282 --> 00:01:27,922
my voice is a little messed up right now,

33
00:01:27,922 --> 00:01:30,322
but I feel like I still have Dave's

34
00:01:30,842 --> 00:01:33,522
voice, like, because I've got Dave's soul

35
00:01:33,522 --> 00:01:36,202
also. Adrian, I'm telling the truth.

36
00:01:36,882 --> 00:01:39,322
All right. So, anyhow, that's the reason

37
00:01:39,322 --> 00:01:41,362
why I cried so much. I couldn't help it.

38
00:01:41,922 --> 00:01:44,842
Because I'm David Lam- and or LeMay and

39
00:01:44,962 --> 00:01:46,962
kept recording, and you don't need to

40
00:01:47,082 --> 00:01:49,362
under- anyway. So, without further

41
00:01:49,362 --> 00:01:50,002
delay...

42
00:01:53,842 --> 00:01:56,082
Let's see what's up. Raggy.

43
00:01:57,802 --> 00:01:57,922
Ohh All

44
00:02:03,602 --> 00:02:06,362
right, we're doing mic check two. Let's

45
00:02:06,402 --> 00:02:08,763
see what happens. I take some gains and

46
00:02:08,763 --> 00:02:10,083
stuff, so let's do it.

47
00:02:14,963 --> 00:02:16,483
Okay, one more time. We're doing a

48
00:02:16,483 --> 00:02:18,883
karaoke mic check. Karaoke. Enterprise

49
00:02:18,883 --> 00:02:21,123
talk party. Clear water, Florida,

50
00:02:22,803 --> 00:02:25,683
I take me easy. And Max to play

51
00:02:25,883 --> 00:02:28,563
the park is fast and we call

52
00:02:28,803 --> 00:02:31,723
it. A circle of light, over a

53
00:02:31,723 --> 00:02:34,523
circle of light. And we call it

54
00:02:36,243 --> 00:02:36,293
a .

55
00:02:47,283 --> 00:02:49,723
Whoa Whoa

56
00:03:02,884 --> 00:03:04,324
Whoa

57
00:03:05,124 --> 00:03:06,004
Whoa

58
00:03:08,484 --> 00:03:08,724
ohh

59
00:03:12,724 --> 00:03:12,884
a

60
00:03:24,324 --> 00:03:26,564
circle of life for a

61
00:03:26,564 --> 00:03:27,964
circle of life

62
00:03:32,164 --> 00:03:34,404
a song about enterprise

63
00:03:35,604 --> 00:03:38,524
to heartI can't

64
00:03:38,564 --> 00:03:41,364
meet the raising air masks. We

65
00:03:41,524 --> 00:03:43,684
play the part 'cause last the soon we we

66
00:03:43,724 --> 00:03:46,444
walk. We call it a circle

67
00:03:46,644 --> 00:03:49,484
of life, or a circle of life. A

68
00:03:52,805 --> 00:03:54,205
circle of life.

69
00:03:55,845 --> 00:03:57,205
When do I have to

70
00:04:06,645 --> 00:04:08,565
Whoa, oh, oh, oh,

71
00:04:10,165 --> 00:04:13,045
oh, oh, oh, oh,

72
00:04:13,445 --> 00:04:13,605
oh.

73
00:04:18,005 --> 00:04:20,925
Songs about... If you've never

74
00:04:20,925 --> 00:04:23,605
heard of Florida, take me to the

75
00:04:23,605 --> 00:04:25,765
easiest path to play.

76
00:04:27,205 --> 00:04:29,845
That's where we walk. We call

77
00:04:30,005 --> 00:04:32,765
it a circle of life, or a

78
00:04:32,765 --> 00:04:33,565
circle of life.

79
00:04:39,845 --> 00:04:42,366
Oh ohh yeah! I love that

80
00:04:42,726 --> 00:04:45,686
song! Thank

81
00:04:45,686 --> 00:04:47,606
you so much for letting me share that

82
00:04:47,606 --> 00:04:49,286
with you. If you watch that along, we're

83
00:04:49,286 --> 00:04:52,006
so grateful. All right. And then we have

84
00:04:52,006 --> 00:04:54,806
such a treat today because Harold and

85
00:04:54,806 --> 00:04:57,406
Kumar got to go to White

86
00:04:57,526 --> 00:05:00,486
Castle. All right, so let's shut this out

87
00:05:00,526 --> 00:05:03,046
real quick and we're gonna go intohere. I

88
00:05:03,206 --> 00:05:05,046
think we finished up our coffee process,

89
00:05:05,286 --> 00:05:07,286
we should be. All right.

90
00:05:18,626 --> 00:05:21,026
Umm All right, let's check this out.

91
00:05:23,666 --> 00:05:25,906
Harold and Kumar, or rather

92
00:05:26,466 --> 00:05:29,426
Ahmed and Kent, are pissed

93
00:05:29,426 --> 00:05:32,386
at each other 'cause a man locked us out

94
00:05:32,386 --> 00:05:35,287
of the freaking soul, man. And I'm so

95
00:05:35,287 --> 00:05:37,447
angry. Me too. Ah

96
00:05:38,967 --> 00:05:40,927
He's like, what do you mean it

97
00:05:41,007 --> 00:05:42,887
automatically locks when you close the

98
00:05:42,887 --> 00:05:45,767
door?I'm like, the thing has got a stereo

99
00:05:45,767 --> 00:05:48,407
system from like yesteryear.

100
00:05:48,407 --> 00:05:50,967
It was like $20,000 stereo system.

101
00:05:51,527 --> 00:05:53,927
So anyhow, now

102
00:05:54,487 --> 00:05:56,487
we have to walk over to John's

103
00:05:57,527 --> 00:06:00,407
auto shop, who's got his son, hey

104
00:06:00,567 --> 00:06:02,487
man, keep it going too slow.

105
00:06:04,407 --> 00:06:06,567
So we have to walk over to John's Auto

106
00:06:06,567 --> 00:06:08,887
Shop and meet with Ben

107
00:06:09,767 --> 00:06:11,607
and we got somebody coming by. What's up

108
00:06:11,607 --> 00:06:13,287
buddy?How you doing man?

109
00:06:14,567 --> 00:06:16,487
Alright. So,

110
00:06:17,807 --> 00:06:19,007
woo! Ah

111
00:06:21,847 --> 00:06:24,808
How are you

112
00:06:24,848 --> 00:06:27,528
guys doing today?My name's Ken.

113
00:06:27,568 --> 00:06:30,008
What's your name?

114
00:06:30,808 --> 00:06:33,648
Anna. Anna, and what's her name?

115
00:06:34,728 --> 00:06:37,488
Joe. Joe. Yeah. Hi, Joe and

116
00:06:37,488 --> 00:06:39,688
Anna. I'm Harold, and this is Kumar.

117
00:06:41,128 --> 00:06:42,808
Actually, it's Ahmed and Ken.

118
00:06:45,768 --> 00:06:48,408
We're going to White Castle. Just

119
00:06:48,488 --> 00:06:51,288
kidding. We're going to John's over there

120
00:06:51,848 --> 00:06:54,368
because a med doesn't realize that you

121
00:06:54,368 --> 00:06:57,208
never close the door of a vehicle

122
00:06:57,768 --> 00:07:00,728
when it's running. Because if

123
00:07:00,728 --> 00:07:02,808
you do, it might lock itself.

124
00:07:03,928 --> 00:07:06,888
So now, we have to go talk to

125
00:07:06,888 --> 00:07:09,688
Ben, who is our best buddy

126
00:07:09,688 --> 00:07:11,328
from Enterprise Dog Park, I might add.

127
00:07:11,448 --> 00:07:13,448
True. Because we both met at Enterprise

128
00:07:13,648 --> 00:07:15,529
Dog Park. And so,

129
00:07:16,769 --> 00:07:18,569
anyhow, it's all good.

130
00:07:20,089 --> 00:07:22,649
I said some very loud words, but they

131
00:07:22,649 --> 00:07:24,569
were well-intentioned,

132
00:07:25,609 --> 00:07:28,129
actually. You guys, we'll go this way.

133
00:07:29,009 --> 00:07:31,649
We'll take this one and then we'll go

134
00:07:31,649 --> 00:07:32,169
this way.

135
00:07:35,609 --> 00:07:38,409
All right. We have 23,

136
00:07:38,889 --> 00:07:41,049
22, 20 here.

137
00:07:46,969 --> 00:07:47,049
All

138
00:07:51,889 --> 00:07:54,409
right. So we make a

139
00:07:54,729 --> 00:07:57,529
soul quest out of this, right?So

140
00:07:57,529 --> 00:07:59,849
we had to leave my Fifth Element, who's

141
00:07:59,849 --> 00:08:02,249
my girlfriend, and also the hottest girl

142
00:08:02,249 --> 00:08:03,649
in the universe, something like that,

143
00:08:04,489 --> 00:08:07,250
back with the Soul Van, right?

144
00:08:08,650 --> 00:08:10,530
And now we have to walk here to get this

145
00:08:10,530 --> 00:08:13,450
special part so we can unlock the Soul

146
00:08:13,450 --> 00:08:16,090
Van and get back to our journey and our

147
00:08:16,090 --> 00:08:18,970
mission of helping the people

148
00:08:18,970 --> 00:08:21,890
who are in food deserts and

149
00:08:22,050 --> 00:08:24,890
need assistance or who haven't had a

150
00:08:25,090 --> 00:08:27,490
dog in a long time. well

151
00:08:28,370 --> 00:08:30,250
Just need a ride to the food pantry.

152
00:08:31,450 --> 00:08:33,770
Because that's why we got the soul van

153
00:08:33,810 --> 00:08:36,690
for it. So. You said your name was

154
00:08:36,810 --> 00:08:39,330
Eve?Oh,

155
00:08:39,330 --> 00:08:41,930
Anna. Anna. All right. So we're going to

156
00:08:41,930 --> 00:08:44,690
put this on the show tonight. And

157
00:08:44,810 --> 00:08:47,450
so I have a show. And it's episode four

158
00:08:47,450 --> 00:08:50,170
that's going to be on tonight. And it's

159
00:08:50,810 --> 00:08:52,090
Clearwater Cruising

160
00:08:53,050 --> 00:08:54,170
Ministries.

161
00:08:55,210 --> 00:08:57,931
Ministries. because we

162
00:08:57,931 --> 00:08:59,771
are like a Christian

163
00:09:00,091 --> 00:09:02,411
organization that is Christ-focused,

164
00:09:03,451 --> 00:09:04,771
non-denominational,

165
00:09:06,411 --> 00:09:07,611
but definitely

166
00:09:08,731 --> 00:09:09,611
God-fearing.

167
00:09:11,131 --> 00:09:13,451
Clearwater Cruisin Ministries.

168
00:09:14,331 --> 00:09:16,891
Let us walk across. All right, here.

169
00:09:18,331 --> 00:09:21,131
Ooh I'm manic

170
00:09:21,211 --> 00:09:24,091
right now. I had such a great

171
00:09:24,131 --> 00:09:26,411
day, though. We went to the dog park.

172
00:09:27,371 --> 00:09:30,291
and then um we got the

173
00:09:30,291 --> 00:09:32,811
soul man out of Safelite Auto Glass

174
00:09:33,771 --> 00:09:36,491
because the deflector shields otherwise

175
00:09:36,491 --> 00:09:37,891
known as the windshield

176
00:09:39,291 --> 00:09:42,011
got damaged when the fifth element

177
00:09:42,131 --> 00:09:44,931
threw her transceiver device at its

178
00:09:44,931 --> 00:09:47,371
swift flick. It was horrible

179
00:09:48,091 --> 00:09:50,212
but we're getting it fixed and you have a

180
00:09:50,212 --> 00:09:52,012
good one Anna. Anna?

181
00:09:52,972 --> 00:09:54,972
Awesome! You have a good one!

182
00:09:59,292 --> 00:09:59,772
All right.

183
00:10:03,932 --> 00:10:06,812
This is fun. Held

184
00:10:06,812 --> 00:10:09,372
in Kumar, go to White Castle.

185
00:10:10,332 --> 00:10:12,332
Yeah! And see,

186
00:10:13,532 --> 00:10:16,412
he is not single, ladies. This

187
00:10:16,412 --> 00:10:17,532
man is taken.

188
00:10:19,852 --> 00:10:22,492
Not me. Not me.

189
00:10:23,492 --> 00:10:25,692
Not me. We know who your soul flame is.

190
00:10:27,052 --> 00:10:28,812
Ah Anyhow.

191
00:10:30,812 --> 00:10:32,892
So we're going up to see Ben here.

192
00:10:36,012 --> 00:10:38,732
And we're having fun doing this.

193
00:10:39,092 --> 00:10:41,733
What a great way. So here's another

194
00:10:41,733 --> 00:10:42,973
important lesson.

195
00:10:44,333 --> 00:10:47,293
Always turn a

196
00:10:47,293 --> 00:10:49,693
disadvantage into an advantage.

197
00:10:50,453 --> 00:10:52,813
And right now, what we get is extra Soul

198
00:10:52,813 --> 00:10:55,373
Quest points. Because as it

199
00:10:55,373 --> 00:10:57,613
happens, we're going to get to meet Ben.

200
00:10:58,933 --> 00:11:01,213
Gesundheit. Gesundheit.

201
00:11:02,653 --> 00:11:04,973
Gesundheit. HuhI said

202
00:11:04,973 --> 00:11:05,693
Gesundheit.

203
00:11:10,893 --> 00:11:13,693
Oh, ohh look at the plane. What an

204
00:11:13,693 --> 00:11:15,893
awesome day to be locked out of the van.

205
00:11:15,893 --> 00:11:18,093
Where is it, look at it?Right up here.

206
00:11:22,693 --> 00:11:24,493
And you can send this to your brother.

207
00:11:25,773 --> 00:11:28,573
Seriously. Hey brother,

208
00:11:28,573 --> 00:11:30,814
what's up Mohammed?Hey, what's up?How are

209
00:11:30,814 --> 00:11:33,734
you today?We're having

210
00:11:33,734 --> 00:11:36,574
an advent shot. Woo!

211
00:11:38,494 --> 00:11:38,934
All right.

212
00:11:49,534 --> 00:11:52,294
And you're going to break a

213
00:11:52,294 --> 00:11:54,174
lot of hearts. I wish.

214
00:11:55,854 --> 00:11:57,894
You have broken a lot of hearts. I've

215
00:11:57,894 --> 00:12:00,414
broken a lot of hearts, and I'm sorry to

216
00:12:00,414 --> 00:12:03,214
all of them. But I have given

217
00:12:03,214 --> 00:12:05,934
my heart to my fifth element, and she can

218
00:12:05,934 --> 00:12:08,654
have it any moment. But

219
00:12:08,654 --> 00:12:10,574
she's my mother Gaia also,

220
00:12:11,694 --> 00:12:13,374
and everything else, Aphrodite and

221
00:12:13,374 --> 00:12:14,814
everything. No hard feelings.

222
00:12:18,894 --> 00:12:21,855
How are you today?I am

223
00:12:21,855 --> 00:12:24,535
awesome. Glad to be

224
00:12:24,535 --> 00:12:27,415
alive. With my best

225
00:12:27,415 --> 00:12:28,815
buddy, Ahmed. That

226
00:12:40,575 --> 00:12:42,975
is hot. Look at that.

227
00:12:43,735 --> 00:12:44,215
That's nice.

228
00:12:49,255 --> 00:12:51,615
Alright... Ben is so cool, and John is so

229
00:12:51,615 --> 00:12:54,455

business...

232
00:12:58,655 --> 00:13:01,015
Honest and integrous... Hi Ben... Ah

233
00:13:05,855 --> 00:13:08,095
So, we're over here at John's Auto Care,

234
00:13:08,415 --> 00:13:11,135
and we're speaking with Ben... I

235
00:13:11,135 --> 00:13:13,296
signed him. How you know him, man?Yeah,

236
00:13:13,376 --> 00:13:15,216
we used to hang out at the dog park. How

237
00:13:15,216 --> 00:13:15,936
are you doing?

238
00:13:18,376 --> 00:13:21,056
You're walking here. I don't know

239
00:13:21,736 --> 00:13:24,696
that. You know, I

240
00:13:26,576 --> 00:13:28,336
walked out from the van, and just

241
00:13:30,336 --> 00:13:33,216
in the van. It's a small world after all.

242
00:13:33,376 --> 00:13:35,616
It's a small world after all. It's a

243
00:13:35,696 --> 00:13:37,896
small world after all. It's a small world

244
00:13:38,136 --> 00:13:40,856
after all. It's a world,

245
00:13:41,296 --> 00:13:42,536
but it's a world. This is so awesome.

246
00:13:44,096 --> 00:13:46,096
What a beautiful day. Right here in

247
00:13:46,096 --> 00:13:46,896

00:14:20,577 --> 00:14:23,217
light pup on the dash occasionally, and I

260
00:14:23,217 --> 00:14:26,137

00:14:26,137 --> 00:14:28,417
out, it used to be they go off,

262
00:14:29,257 --> 00:14:31,377
but we didn't let them check it out.

263
00:14:31,377 --> 00:14:32,817
Yeah, well all I know is I've known this

00:14:44,417 --> 00:14:47,217
I usually go to Trent and stop but you

269
00:14:47,217 --> 00:14:49,857
know I'd rather find a small place.

270
00:14:50,497 --> 00:14:53,137
They saved me a ton of money on my

271
00:14:53,137 --> 00:14:55,778
Cadillac and on my Trenton G6

272
00:14:56,858 --> 00:14:58,738
which I have photographed in front of

273
00:14:58,738 --> 00:15:00,738

00:15:18,418 --> 00:15:20,898

291
00:15:50,259 --> 00:15:52,659
and I am very grateful for all that he's

292
00:15:52,659 --> 00:15:54,339
done for me as one of the very best

293
00:15:54,339 --> 00:15:56,819
mechanics that I know in this great land

294
00:15:56,859 --> 00:15:58,859

296
00:16:01,659 --> 00:16:03,339
Awesome! Huh

Thank you guys, we'll be right back.

298
00:16:08,659 --> 00:16:11,219
We did go right back, by the way, and we

299
00:16:12,099 --> 00:16:14,259
solved our problem, and he was so

300
00:16:14,259 --> 00:16:17,219
awesome. And this is that, but

301
00:16:17,219 --> 00:16:19,539
I'm a long time customer and dog park

302
00:16:19,539 --> 00:16:19,859
friend.

303
00:16:22,659 --> 00:16:24,899
In a previous life we were, um

304
00:16:25,859 --> 00:16:26,419
I don't know.

305
00:17:06,100 --> 00:17:08,260
So, this was a short walk. Sorry it got

306
00:17:08,260 --> 00:17:10,020
really quiet here, but it does look

307
00:17:10,020 --> 00:17:12,740
really cool, you knowLike, I

308
00:17:12,740 --> 00:17:14,340
just really wanted to get this. It was so

309
00:17:14,340 --> 00:17:16,100
much fun. It was just such an awesome

310
00:17:16,100 --> 00:17:18,660
experience. Just out of the blue, we got

311
00:17:18,660 --> 00:17:20,340
locked out of the truck. At first I was

312
00:17:20,340 --> 00:17:22,180
really frustrated, and then I realized

313
00:17:22,180 --> 00:17:24,540
that we had the perfect Harold and

314
00:17:24,540 --> 00:17:27,380
Kumar adventure to have with each

315
00:17:27,380 --> 00:17:28,941
other. And And we've been friends for a

316
00:17:28,941 --> 00:17:30,901
long time. Do you know Ben also from the

317
00:17:30,901 --> 00:17:33,781
park?You know Ben from the

318
00:17:33,781 --> 00:17:36,741
park also. That

319
00:17:36,741 --> 00:17:38,261
is so awesome, man.

320
00:17:41,541 --> 00:17:44,421
See?I'm telling you, we have

321
00:17:44,421 --> 00:17:46,181

322
00:17:47,861 --> 00:17:49,461
Woo! Huh

323
00:17:52,261 --> 00:17:55,181
I think we go like this way. Huh

324
00:18:12,701 --> 00:18:13,741
Good afternoon.

325
00:18:16,701 --> 00:18:16,981
Huh What

326
00:18:23,782 --> 00:18:26,702
an awesome adventure. Harold and

327
00:18:26,702 --> 00:18:28,662
Cubar go to White Castle.

328
00:18:29,262 --> 00:18:32,222
What?Is this

329
00:18:32,222 --> 00:18:34,902
not fun or what?It is

330
00:18:34,902 --> 00:18:36,902
fun. It's total blast.

331
00:18:37,702 --> 00:18:38,022
Ohh

332
00:18:41,142 --> 00:18:42,982
All right, I don't want to stop the fun

333
00:18:42,982 --> 00:18:45,862
here. Let's-- I am going to stop it for a

334
00:18:45,862 --> 00:18:47,662
second. That was a great take. We'll be

335
00:18:47,662 --> 00:18:49,862
back in a second, actually, I guess. OK,

336
00:18:49,942 --> 00:18:50,182
bye.

337
00:18:56,952 --> 00:18:58,872
All right, OK, now we're crossing the

338
00:18:59,032 --> 00:19:01,992
walk here. Be careful, whoa, whoa, howdy,

339
00:19:01,992 --> 00:19:02,192
howdy,

340
00:19:05,112 --> 00:19:07,622
ho, ho, ho, all right. All right, thank

341
00:19:07,662 --> 00:19:07,862
you.

342
00:19:14,583 --> 00:19:14,663
Ah

343
00:19:23,863 --> 00:19:26,023
And we are very good looking, by the way,

344
00:19:26,023 --> 00:19:28,903
duhLike we're better looking than they

345
00:19:28,903 --> 00:19:31,703
are, actually. Who?

346
00:19:32,103 --> 00:19:34,823
Heldon Kumar. I

347
00:19:34,823 --> 00:19:36,903
know I'm better looking than that. Come

348
00:19:36,903 --> 00:19:39,063
on now. Huh

349
00:19:40,183 --> 00:19:42,583
Anyhow, are we going to take this?Nah.

350
00:19:45,303 --> 00:19:45,383
Uh

351
00:19:49,223 --> 00:19:50,983
It is definitely warm out here.

352
00:19:54,263 --> 00:19:56,023
And I'm glad you were paying attention in

353
00:19:56,023 --> 00:19:57,943
break in class, because I missed it.

354
00:20:00,463 --> 00:20:03,064
Break in class, class.

355
00:20:03,744 --> 00:20:05,424
We're not going to break the glass. We're

356
00:20:05,424 --> 00:20:08,264
going to break in, and that's the glass.

357
00:20:08,984 --> 00:20:10,984
And you are paying attention to Ben,

358
00:20:12,584 --> 00:20:15,064
which I wasn't because I'm manic, because

359
00:20:15,064 --> 00:20:16,864
I had to figure out how to turn this in.

360
00:20:17,304 --> 00:20:19,224
But man, it's so awesome, because I have

361
00:20:19,224 --> 00:20:21,224
like about a million times more energy

362
00:20:21,224 --> 00:20:23,864
right now. This is way better than a

363
00:20:23,864 --> 00:20:26,024
workout. And we're out here in the middle

364
00:20:26,024 --> 00:20:26,544
of everywhere,

365
00:20:29,704 --> 00:20:31,304
and we get to see all these people out

366
00:20:31,464 --> 00:20:34,384
here. How

367
00:20:34,384 --> 00:20:36,904
are you guys today?What's

368
00:20:44,344 --> 00:20:45,224
up?All right.

369
00:20:52,504 --> 00:20:55,465
Okay. So the quest

370
00:20:55,465 --> 00:20:57,705
continues, and right now we're out along

371
00:20:57,785 --> 00:21:00,145
Route 60 here in

372
00:21:00,185 --> 00:21:02,425
Clearwater in front of the Starbucks

373
00:21:02,425 --> 00:21:03,785
coffee drive-through.

374
00:21:05,785 --> 00:21:07,705
And the Seneca across the street, we

375
00:21:07,745 --> 00:21:10,425
usually call that the Haji or

376
00:21:10,425 --> 00:21:13,305
Habib store in honor of

377
00:21:13,305 --> 00:21:15,905
our Middle Eastern uh

378
00:21:18,425 --> 00:21:20,745
people that come here and set up shop

379
00:21:21,385 --> 00:21:23,705
pretty much. Oh wow, look at this

380
00:21:25,305 --> 00:21:27,145
wrap on this Tesla right here.

381
00:21:29,545 --> 00:21:32,305
The Chanel group, look at that.

382
00:21:32,945 --> 00:21:34,585
Alright, there you go. Uh, there's

383
00:21:34,585 --> 00:21:36,265
Shinaga. Anyway.

384
00:21:39,425 --> 00:21:41,625
Woo! Okay.

385
00:21:44,265 --> 00:21:46,746
I gotta catch up with the med.

386
00:21:53,866 --> 00:21:56,746
What a great day. What a

387
00:21:56,746 --> 00:21:59,666
great day. Ah

388
00:22:04,026 --> 00:22:05,666
All right, that's a nice Cadillac. Very

389
00:22:08,426 --> 00:22:10,146
nice. It is a little large.

390
00:22:13,466 --> 00:22:13,866
All right.

391
00:22:17,386 --> 00:22:18,586
Hello, everyone.

392
00:22:26,986 --> 00:22:29,786
Huhohh

393
00:22:29,906 --> 00:22:31,866
I'm glad I still have that tooth there.

394
00:22:32,266 --> 00:22:34,386
It hurts like a motor figure these days.

395
00:22:37,627 --> 00:22:38,787
Alright, getting a call from

396
00:22:39,227 --> 00:22:41,147
Commander-in-Chief, the Fifth Element.

397
00:22:46,767 --> 00:22:49,247
Alright, let's see what will happen next.

398
00:22:57,407 --> 00:22:59,567
Hey, are strange things put into Circle K?

399
00:22:59,567 --> 00:22:59,727
No.

400
00:23:03,067 --> 00:23:04,187
My name's Ken, by the way.

401
00:23:06,107 --> 00:23:08,667
Hi, George. Well, we're

402
00:23:08,987 --> 00:23:11,867
locked out of the USS Enterprise Soul

403
00:23:11,867 --> 00:23:12,667
Van 1.

404
00:23:14,667 --> 00:23:17,627
But we do have tools to enable

405
00:23:17,627 --> 00:23:20,187
or facilitate access back

406
00:23:20,267 --> 00:23:21,707
to the internal uh

407
00:23:23,787 --> 00:23:26,107
workings of the ship, as it were.

408
00:23:26,427 --> 00:23:29,388
And we are now about to get back in

409
00:23:29,708 --> 00:23:32,508
to the Soul Van 1. What, one more name on

410
00:23:32,508 --> 00:23:33,748
your, one more time on your name?

411
00:23:35,708 --> 00:23:37,588
George. George, I want to say, I only got

412
00:23:37,588 --> 00:23:39,308
a little bit of you. If you're one,

413
00:23:39,388 --> 00:23:41,548
sorry, this goes on to my show. It's

414
00:23:41,668 --> 00:23:43,188
called... Huh

415
00:23:45,388 --> 00:23:47,868
What class of ship?It is

416
00:23:48,268 --> 00:23:50,908
the Excursion class. It's the

417
00:23:50,908 --> 00:23:53,668
Soul Fleet. It's the predecessor to the

418
00:23:53,668 --> 00:23:56,548
Starfleet. Okay, but I've got to

419
00:23:56,548 --> 00:23:58,108
go back there before he breaks it, all

420
00:23:58,108 --> 00:23:59,708
right?Have a blessed day.

421
00:24:04,428 --> 00:24:04,908
All right.

422
00:24:08,908 --> 00:24:11,708
Pause. OK. Hmm

423
00:24:31,349 --> 00:24:32,349
Yeah, we're going to have to use a

424
00:24:32,349 --> 00:24:34,229
different door than this one, by the way.

425
00:24:34,229 --> 00:24:36,269
We have to use the passenger door. Why?

426
00:24:36,749 --> 00:24:38,109
Because I don't have a thing on this

427
00:24:38,109 --> 00:24:40,509
side. Where's the windows?HuhWhere's the

428
00:24:40,869 --> 00:24:43,229
window switch?Right here. This one?

429
00:24:43,629 --> 00:24:45,869
Yeah. OK, we need to use this. That's it.

430
00:24:46,429 --> 00:24:47,309
Open the window. Let's

431
00:24:50,389 --> 00:24:52,349
hook it up. Huh

432
00:25:10,950 --> 00:25:11,670
Right here.

433
00:25:25,910 --> 00:25:28,270
Right there. Do you see it right there?

434
00:25:30,670 --> 00:25:32,790
Yeah. This is so awesome.

435
00:25:36,510 --> 00:25:39,310
Harold and Gomar go

436
00:25:39,310 --> 00:25:42,150
to Walmart. We did it

437
00:25:42,150 --> 00:25:44,270
together, huh? Well, our men and Ken go

438
00:25:44,270 --> 00:25:44,910
to Walmart.

439
00:25:47,270 --> 00:25:48,990
WOOOO!!! Let's go over and give them

440
00:25:51,630 --> 00:25:54,470
some money. Well, we'll go back there

441
00:25:54,470 --> 00:25:55,150
right now, no matter

442
00:26:00,351 --> 00:26:02,551
what. Hi, buddy. Come here, man. Come

443
00:26:02,551 --> 00:26:02,911
here, man.

444
00:26:06,271 --> 00:26:08,191
I'm gonna be cool. You're not so

445
00:26:08,231 --> 00:26:09,231
slobbery, buddy.

446
00:26:12,351 --> 00:26:12,831
Hi, buddy.

447
00:26:17,671 --> 00:26:20,511
Well, we'll

448
00:26:20,511 --> 00:26:22,911
do that later. Right now, we're gonna get

449
00:26:22,911 --> 00:26:23,711
this stuff put up.

450
00:26:31,151 --> 00:26:33,631
Magadip! What a fun

451
00:26:33,631 --> 00:26:36,591
adventure. But we

452
00:26:36,591 --> 00:26:39,311
did get back in the van. It was going to

453
00:26:39,311 --> 00:26:41,951
cost $80 from a lock spit and then I

454
00:26:41,951 --> 00:26:44,871
would have to do a claim or something and

455
00:26:44,871 --> 00:26:47,791
that would be $100 and this was

456
00:26:47,951 --> 00:26:48,271
$10. Woo!

457
00:26:50,711 --> 00:26:52,712
Thank you goodness gracious and thank you

458
00:26:52,712 --> 00:26:54,992
teamwork because we had awesome teamwork.

459
00:26:57,072 --> 00:26:59,032
I lost my cool for a little bit so I'm

460
00:26:59,032 --> 00:27:01,992
really sorry toAhmed about

461
00:27:01,992 --> 00:27:03,632
I was frustrated because I thought

462
00:27:03,632 --> 00:27:05,552
everybody knew that you never leave a

463
00:27:05,552 --> 00:27:08,352
vehicle running ever

464
00:27:08,752 --> 00:27:10,872
if the keys are in the ignition unless

465
00:27:10,912 --> 00:27:11,832
you put a window down.

466
00:27:14,752 --> 00:27:17,392
No our feeling. We had a lot of fun

467
00:27:19,392 --> 00:27:21,232
and really solidified a lot of really

468
00:27:21,232 --> 00:27:23,712
awesome soul threads including Ben

469
00:27:24,272 --> 00:27:27,232
at John's Auto Care because we all knew

470
00:27:27,232 --> 00:27:29,152
each other. That's a real connection.

471
00:27:45,393 --> 00:27:48,353
Huh, they're nice and cold compared to

472
00:27:48,433 --> 00:27:50,913
out here. They're like veritably

473
00:27:50,913 --> 00:27:52,113
freezing. All

474
00:27:55,713 --> 00:27:58,153
right, so take your time. Huh

475
00:28:03,713 --> 00:28:04,513
I didn't take it.

476
00:28:08,513 --> 00:28:10,513
One moment. Missing a bottle of water. We

477
00:28:10,513 --> 00:28:11,153
will find it.

478
00:28:14,273 --> 00:28:16,433
We made an adventure out of it. We made

479
00:28:16,433 --> 00:28:18,313
an adventure out of it. It was awesome.

480
00:28:18,313 --> 00:28:20,593
It was a total freaking soul adventure.

481
00:28:21,153 --> 00:28:23,153
And And it was awesome and we're gonna go

482
00:28:23,153 --> 00:28:25,393
back to talk to Ben real quick. He'd been

483
00:28:25,393 --> 00:28:27,993
super cool and like like

484
00:28:28,273 --> 00:28:30,833
We both independently know Ben. Anyways.

485
00:28:33,473 --> 00:28:35,874
All right. OK. So

486
00:28:36,514 --> 00:28:38,274
that was our Soul Adventure. And then I

487
00:28:38,434 --> 00:28:41,314
really wanted to pull up real quick Kevin

488
00:28:41,314 --> 00:28:43,754
at Radioactive Car Audio. I think I have

489
00:28:43,794 --> 00:28:45,274
some pictures from there. I wanted to

490
00:28:45,274 --> 00:28:47,714
bring up some stuff because I was telling

491
00:28:47,714 --> 00:28:49,834
Kevin from Radioactive Car Audio that I

492
00:28:49,834 --> 00:28:50,994
would talk about them because I was

493
00:28:50,994 --> 00:28:53,274
supposed to take the Soul Van in there to

494
00:28:53,274 --> 00:28:56,114
get an inverter placed. And I wasn't able

495
00:28:56,114 --> 00:28:58,994
to because the Solvans wind deflector

496
00:28:58,994 --> 00:29:01,354
screens needed repaired.

497
00:29:01,354 --> 00:29:04,034
Unfortunately, the people at Safelight

498
00:29:04,514 --> 00:29:06,394
don't know how to jump a vehicle at 7:00

499
00:29:06,394 --> 00:29:08,234
o'clock in the morning or their jump

500
00:29:08,234 --> 00:29:09,874
device didn't work. So we had to take the

501
00:29:09,874 --> 00:29:11,914
van back on Saturday at 3:00 o'clock to

502
00:29:11,954 --> 00:29:14,634
get the deflector screen replaced for the

503
00:29:14,754 --> 00:29:17,314
third time. And we left it there until

504
00:29:17,314 --> 00:29:18,834
Thursday, which is the reason why the

505
00:29:18,914 --> 00:29:21,074
battery went dead because anyway, it

506
00:29:21,074 --> 00:29:22,754
needs a new battery probably.

507
00:29:24,755 --> 00:29:26,875
So that's a lot of info. Real quick,

508
00:29:26,875 --> 00:29:29,475
we're going to see if we can get some

509
00:29:29,475 --> 00:29:32,315
footage of radioactive car audio. And

510
00:29:32,315 --> 00:29:35,155
also, some other

511
00:29:35,155 --> 00:29:37,635
cool stuff here before we go. So

512
00:29:38,035 --> 00:29:40,435
also, we have a really awesome

513
00:29:40,435 --> 00:29:42,355
playlist. So I'm going to pull up one of

514
00:29:42,355 --> 00:29:44,595
those songs real quick, actually, while

515
00:29:45,075 --> 00:29:47,555
I look for something. So let's pull up

516
00:29:47,635 --> 00:29:49,635
one of our songs from our playlist here.

517
00:29:50,195 --> 00:29:52,115
We're going to go back to

518
00:29:54,235 --> 00:29:56,835
uh playlist. Let's listen to Pissed

519
00:29:57,155 --> 00:29:59,995
the Curaleaf Dispensary Closed

520
00:30:00,115 --> 00:30:02,435
Early. And let's just say that

521
00:30:03,075 --> 00:30:05,715
The Fix was me.

522
00:30:06,355 --> 00:30:08,955
The Fix was me. All right, so we're going

523
00:30:08,955 --> 00:30:10,995
to go ahead and listen to Pissed the

524
00:30:10,995 --> 00:30:13,955
Curaleaf Dispensary Closed Early.

525
00:30:14,755 --> 00:30:17,076
And I wrote this song for them and I love

526
00:30:17,156 --> 00:30:19,636
them. Katrina. Rebecca!

527
00:30:19,916 --> 00:30:20,756
Hi, Rebecca!

528
00:30:22,596 --> 00:30:25,036
Listen when people like, pay attention to

529
00:30:27,836 --> 00:30:30,196
this. You're kind of a block.

530
00:30:35,636 --> 00:30:35,876
Ohh

531
00:30:43,276 --> 00:30:43,916
I'm sorry... Why did

532
00:30:46,516 --> 00:30:47,716
I fix that?Alright.

533
00:31:01,316 --> 00:31:03,796
Hunt the horn, yeah, I'm

534
00:31:04,236 --> 00:31:05,756
right around the door But they locked it

535
00:31:05,756 --> 00:31:07,597
up tight like they don't need more I'll

536
00:31:07,597 --> 00:31:08,797
get this down. I got a semi-char mic

537
00:31:08,797 --> 00:31:11,237
down. So why am I trippin' if they don't

538
00:31:11,277 --> 00:31:13,997
give a damn Baby, I'm trippin', but that

539
00:31:13,997 --> 00:31:15,597
ain't mine Took a while to get it up. 15

540
00:31:15,597 --> 00:31:18,197
minutes. Why should I care, they ain't

541
00:31:20,117 --> 00:31:21,877
really no bones Guess on me, I got the

542
00:31:22,117 --> 00:31:23,157
late, I know But it's frustrating as

543
00:31:24,437 --> 00:31:25,477
hell, but the kind of don't show Aw, man,

544
00:31:25,477 --> 00:31:26,197
that messed it up.

545
00:32:19,638 --> 00:32:20,598
I'm out here

546
00:32:23,958 --> 00:32:25,798
wondering What's the fix?

547
00:32:49,719 --> 00:32:52,399
That's a great song. I highly

548
00:32:52,399 --> 00:32:54,119
recommend you jam out to it when you go

549
00:32:54,119 --> 00:32:56,999
to Curling. We already know

550
00:32:56,999 --> 00:32:59,959
that one. All right, we're going to go

551
00:32:59,959 --> 00:33:01,439
ahead and look in our photo album real

552
00:33:01,439 --> 00:33:04,359
quick for anything related to...

553
00:33:07,559 --> 00:33:09,079
Ah, Radioactive.

554
00:33:10,519 --> 00:33:12,079
Oh, there's my favorite couple.

555
00:33:13,319 --> 00:33:16,279
Doctors Randi and Adonica Howard-Brown,

556
00:33:16,279 --> 00:33:18,839
who had me beat up and thrown in jail.

557
00:33:20,279 --> 00:33:22,199
Misunderstanding, no hard feelings, guys.

558
00:33:22,679 --> 00:33:24,239
If you ever want to hang out, just give

559
00:33:24,399 --> 00:33:24,839
me a call.

560
00:33:25,079 --> 00:33:27,479
727-656-4443.

561
00:33:28,279 --> 00:33:30,879
Feel free, give me a call, say hello. I'd

562
00:33:30,879 --> 00:33:33,559
love to hang out sometime. Thank you

563
00:33:33,639 --> 00:33:36,359
for a ride as we pass by.

564
00:33:37,799 --> 00:33:40,480
Anyway, not feelies, guys. Come on.

565
00:33:45,880 --> 00:33:48,600
Oh, oh, oh, oh,

566
00:33:48,840 --> 00:33:50,1000
okay. We're trying to find that. Let's

567
00:33:54,200 --> 00:33:55,960
see if we can find it this way.

568
00:33:56,1000 --> 00:33:59,320
In this riot, spirit sleep

569
00:34:01,320 --> 00:34:03,960
The journeythey

570
00:34:03,960 --> 00:34:06,640
don't say it Rides like a Cadillac for

571
00:34:06,920 --> 00:34:09,360
nothing we thrive Awesome Cadillac right

572
00:34:09,360 --> 00:34:12,040
there From Harpo Springs to the

573
00:34:12,120 --> 00:34:14,920
Cadillac CTS they don't say it

574
00:34:14,920 --> 00:34:17,600
Rides like a Cadillac for nothing we

575
00:34:17,640 --> 00:34:20,560
thrive From Tarpon Springs to St.

576
00:34:20,600 --> 00:34:23,480
Pete Shore In our elegant rides

577
00:34:23,680 --> 00:34:26,560
we explore Feels

578
00:34:26,560 --> 00:34:28,920
race beneath the sky All right, let's

579
00:34:28,920 --> 00:34:29,600
pause the music

580
00:34:45,001 --> 00:34:46,481
Cadillac for nothing. We

581
00:34:49,401 --> 00:34:50,001
are humming.

582
00:34:54,681 --> 00:34:55,321
All right?

583
00:35:04,601 --> 00:35:07,321
All right, we'll pause that for a moment.

584
00:35:07,321 --> 00:35:09,761
We're gonna go back over. I really wanted

585
00:35:09,761 --> 00:35:12,121
to show this off real quick. So this is

586
00:35:12,161 --> 00:35:15,001
the Episcopal Church of the Ascension in

587
00:35:15,001 --> 00:35:17,961
downtown Clearwater. And I'm a huge fan

588
00:35:17,961 --> 00:35:19,961
of like everything

589
00:35:19,961 --> 00:35:22,882
Tartaria is awesome. And

590
00:35:22,882 --> 00:35:25,122
this right here, this Church of the

591
00:35:25,122 --> 00:35:27,962
Ascension is so

592
00:35:28,082 --> 00:35:30,642
exquisitely beautiful on the

593
00:35:30,842 --> 00:35:33,482
outside. I can hardly wait to

594
00:35:33,482 --> 00:35:36,282
attend service here. I'm so looking

595
00:35:36,282 --> 00:35:37,922
forward to it. Hopefully they won't

596
00:35:37,922 --> 00:35:39,242
trespass me when I

597
00:35:41,962 --> 00:35:44,362
politely and penitently

598
00:35:44,362 --> 00:35:46,762
enter that beautiful

599
00:35:46,762 --> 00:35:49,362
structure and listen to what must be a

600
00:35:49,362 --> 00:35:51,762
most amazing pipe organ and an

601
00:35:52,162 --> 00:35:55,002
amazing experience. Look at

602
00:35:55,002 --> 00:35:57,962
that flower there, the Church

603
00:35:58,002 --> 00:36:00,122
of Iesus flower, this structure.

604
00:36:01,042 --> 00:36:02,442
is incredible.

605
00:36:03,962 --> 00:36:06,842
Ohh If it ever

606
00:36:06,842 --> 00:36:09,002
loads. Okay, let's

607
00:36:10,122 --> 00:36:12,442
see that. Maybe we'll look at that

608
00:36:12,442 --> 00:36:15,403
another day because all it is

609
00:36:15,403 --> 00:36:18,203
is a drive-by. So I got it there

610
00:36:18,203 --> 00:36:20,603
and I got it there and you can see it's

611
00:36:20,603 --> 00:36:23,483
just beautiful. And those stained glass

612
00:36:23,483 --> 00:36:25,803
windows are amazing.

613
00:36:26,683 --> 00:36:28,723
Anyhow, so I did take a little tour

614
00:36:28,723 --> 00:36:31,563
around there. um

615
00:36:35,043 --> 00:36:36,763
And that was the chip with the Med there.

616
00:36:37,083 --> 00:36:38,683
And we had a nice little,

617
00:36:43,243 --> 00:36:44,923
couple of nice things. I won't pull that

618
00:36:44,923 --> 00:36:46,483
up right now 'cause we're talking about

619
00:36:46,483 --> 00:36:49,083
radioactive car audio here. So this is

620
00:36:49,163 --> 00:36:51,443
our, let's see if we can find

621
00:36:51,443 --> 00:36:52,523
radio.

622
00:36:59,683 --> 00:37:02,443
There you go. Let's see what we got. So

623
00:37:02,443 --> 00:37:05,164
this is what we got, I think. I don't

624
00:37:05,164 --> 00:37:06,924
really have any video there, umm

625
00:37:09,404 --> 00:37:11,684
but I've been there a bunch and they did

626
00:37:11,684 --> 00:37:14,604
a really great job on my subwoofer in the

627
00:37:14,604 --> 00:37:17,084
Cadillac. I mean, I could more highly

628
00:37:17,084 --> 00:37:19,484
recommend Kevin and his

629
00:37:19,564 --> 00:37:21,724
expert team of

630
00:37:21,724 --> 00:37:24,204
installers. He's been in business there

631
00:37:24,204 --> 00:37:26,764
forever. He is an institution,

632
00:37:27,164 --> 00:37:29,604
he's awesome, he's fun, he's reasonable.

633
00:37:29,884 --> 00:37:32,364
and they just do awesome work.

634
00:37:32,764 --> 00:37:34,844
And I just love hanging out with him and

635
00:37:34,844 --> 00:37:36,924
the gang there whenever I get the chance.

636
00:37:36,924 --> 00:37:39,164
I'm not saying go there and hang out, but

637
00:37:39,644 --> 00:37:41,524
he really actually does like hanging out

638
00:37:41,524 --> 00:37:44,284
and talking and and everything. So thank

639
00:37:44,284 --> 00:37:46,924
you, Kevin. I look forward to seeing you

640
00:37:46,924 --> 00:37:49,884
soon to get that inverter

641
00:37:51,164 --> 00:37:53,804
uh installed properly in the back of the

642
00:37:53,804 --> 00:37:56,285
solar van so that our subwoofer can

643
00:37:56,765 --> 00:37:59,005
properly project itsholy

644
00:37:59,005 --> 00:38:01,805
frequencies of loving kindness

645
00:38:01,805 --> 00:38:04,725
out to the world. Thank you, Kevin.

646
00:38:04,765 --> 00:38:05,725
We love

647
00:38:07,325 --> 00:38:10,045
radioactive car audio. They are

648
00:38:10,205 --> 00:38:13,085
so awesome. Anyway, just

649
00:38:13,245 --> 00:38:15,005
got to give them super shout out. All

650
00:38:15,165 --> 00:38:16,965
right, and they did a great job on the

651
00:38:16,965 --> 00:38:19,565
subwoofer. And you can hear the subwoofer

652
00:38:19,565 --> 00:38:22,445
all the time. As you know, in in

653
00:38:22,445 --> 00:38:25,325
our videos, we have this awesome thing.

654
00:38:25,725 --> 00:38:28,405
Here's going to court, by the way. Look

655
00:38:28,445 --> 00:38:31,165
at the super hotty. Anyway,

656
00:38:31,805 --> 00:38:34,605
she's like, ahShe

657
00:38:34,605 --> 00:38:37,165
was frustrated. She's super hot.

658
00:38:37,765 --> 00:38:39,525
She's the Fifth Element. That wasn't,

659
00:38:39,525 --> 00:38:41,805
anyway, my Fifth Element. All right.

660
00:38:44,925 --> 00:38:47,125
Okay, so now we talked about the Safe

661
00:38:47,125 --> 00:38:49,006
Light, and I also wanted to give more

662
00:38:49,006 --> 00:38:51,166
shout outs to my

663
00:38:51,646 --> 00:38:52,446
favorite

664
00:38:55,726 --> 00:38:58,686
vape shop, Strange Clouds. And

665
00:38:58,686 --> 00:39:00,166
there's another vape shop I go to

666
00:39:00,286 --> 00:39:01,926
regularly, which I'll give a shout out to

667
00:39:01,966 --> 00:39:04,606
separately because they're awesome also.

668
00:39:05,006 --> 00:39:06,606
But I just love Strange Clouds because

669
00:39:06,606 --> 00:39:09,246
it's just so much fun to go into it.

670
00:39:10,206 --> 00:39:13,166
Um Also,

671
00:39:13,166 --> 00:39:16,126
real quick, we had like a really great,

672
00:39:16,846 --> 00:39:18,606
awesome experience. I want to show this

673
00:39:18,606 --> 00:39:20,046
one thing. This was actually

674
00:39:20,526 --> 00:39:23,086
serendipitously shot, meaning I did not

675
00:39:23,086 --> 00:39:25,006
press the button. You can see my hand is

676
00:39:25,006 --> 00:39:27,646
clearly on the steering wheel. And we

677
00:39:27,646 --> 00:39:29,886
were going around to pantry to pantry

678
00:39:29,886 --> 00:39:32,326
here. And I'll show just a little glimpse

679
00:39:32,326 --> 00:39:33,686
of this because I'm trying to keep the

680
00:39:33,686 --> 00:39:36,126
runtime on this one short. But

681
00:39:36,446 --> 00:39:38,446
this is a scene where I'm actually-- this

682
00:39:38,446 --> 00:39:39,807
was not taken by me.

683
00:39:52,637 --> 00:39:52,677
Ah

684
00:40:14,847 --> 00:40:16,287
We're going to try to download it. I've

685
00:40:16,287 --> 00:40:19,167
got it downloading right there. Ah,

686
00:40:19,327 --> 00:40:22,127
here it comes. I

687
00:40:22,127 --> 00:40:23,887
need it anyhow, and I think I made a

688
00:40:23,887 --> 00:40:25,087
better version of it.

689
00:40:35,078 --> 00:40:37,078
Now I'm looking in my captures directory.

690
00:40:37,078 --> 00:40:38,198
I want to see if I have

691
00:40:41,558 --> 00:40:42,758
that particular

692
00:40:52,128 --> 00:40:53,888
All right, guys, hold on. Wait, I was

693
00:40:53,888 --> 00:40:55,728
just... Okay, these are the secret

694
00:40:55,728 --> 00:40:57,608
archives. I can't show 'cause this is one

695
00:40:57,968 --> 00:40:59,448
that supposedly went on the deep end and

696
00:40:59,448 --> 00:41:01,928
actually had a samadhi experience. Ohh

697
00:41:03,488 --> 00:41:06,008
Responded. A really serious samadhi

698
00:41:06,008 --> 00:41:08,208
experience. Enjoy. Genuinely. And when

699
00:41:08,368 --> 00:41:10,448
she's... And she's... Okay. Um..

700
00:41:14,288 --> 00:41:15,328
Greeting. Um..

701
00:41:23,329 --> 00:41:24,449
Go on here.

702
00:41:55,729 --> 00:41:57,329
real quick and then go back home and drop

703
00:41:57,329 --> 00:41:58,489
off and go to the bathroom and go back to

704
00:41:58,489 --> 00:41:59,609
the dog park. Is that okay, Fifth Element?

705
00:42:00,289 --> 00:42:01,409
Yeah, yeah, yeahNo, I'm speaking to the

706
00:42:01,409 --> 00:42:03,889
Fifth Element. Um, yeah, but you need to

707
00:42:03,889 --> 00:42:04,769
ask, you might not. I understand

708
00:42:07,089 --> 00:42:10,009
what you're saying. Do you want

709
00:42:10,009 --> 00:42:11,689
to go see something beautiful real quick?

710
00:42:14,610 --> 00:42:17,530
Ohh Is it open?Do you need it?

711
00:42:18,610 --> 00:42:20,530
Alright, so this is the one, anyway.

712
00:42:21,010 --> 00:42:23,890
Alright. so van um

713
00:42:29,970 --> 00:42:30,530
let's see it

714
00:42:42,650 --> 00:42:44,090
oh there was already there

715
00:43:08,131 --> 00:43:09,811
Real quick and then go back home and drop

716
00:43:09,811 --> 00:43:11,331
off to go to the bathroom and go back to

717
00:43:11,331 --> 00:43:14,291
the dog park. Is that OK?Fit the element?

718
00:43:17,131 --> 00:43:17,251
Yeah.

719
00:43:49,161 --> 00:43:51,001
Hey there, I want to take.

720
00:46:06,624 --> 00:46:09,304
All right. Okay. So I got

721
00:46:09,304 --> 00:46:11,904
carried away, and I made a video, and I

722
00:46:11,904 --> 00:46:14,864
wasn't even anything. So you

723
00:46:14,864 --> 00:46:16,704
just sat with me for a few minutes. I

724
00:46:16,704 --> 00:46:18,224
should probably edit that out, but I

725
00:46:18,224 --> 00:46:20,704
don't ever edit this stuff out. So I made

726
00:46:20,704 --> 00:46:22,944
this video, which is

727
00:46:23,104 --> 00:46:26,094
honestly truthful. I did

728
00:46:26,094 --> 00:46:27,735
not press the record button.

729
00:46:29,095 --> 00:46:31,575
I... did not... press the

730
00:46:31,575 --> 00:46:32,455
record button.

731
00:46:35,895 --> 00:46:37,815
Who pressed the record button?

732
00:46:40,415 --> 00:46:42,015
Go real quick and then go back home and

733
00:46:42,015 --> 00:46:43,655
drop off the... go to the bathroom and go

734
00:46:43,655 --> 00:46:46,495
back to the dog park. Is that okay?Fifth

735
00:46:46,495 --> 00:46:49,095
Element?No, no, noNo, I'm speaking to the

736
00:46:49,095 --> 00:46:51,175
Fifth Element. Um, yeah, but you need to

737
00:46:51,175 --> 00:46:53,775
ask him. He might not. We were on a

738
00:46:53,775 --> 00:46:56,215
mission of philanthropy of mercy.

739
00:46:59,535 --> 00:47:02,255
Ohh Is it open?And this

740
00:47:02,255 --> 00:47:05,055
Soul Van one, USS Enterprise. Okay,

741
00:47:05,255 --> 00:47:07,575
let's do it. All right. Soul Van. If I

742
00:47:10,295 --> 00:47:12,775
open somebody else up, it uh, asked me

743
00:47:13,335 --> 00:47:15,175
to. Activate subwoofer!

744
00:47:18,735 --> 00:47:20,776
Ready, player! Everyone!

745
00:47:21,816 --> 00:47:24,376
Everyone gets an angel! Go

746
00:47:24,976 --> 00:47:26,336
back home and drop off. All right. Go to

747
00:47:26,456 --> 00:47:27,536
the bathroom and go back to the club

748
00:47:27,576 --> 00:47:29,176
park. Is that

749
00:47:30,456 --> 00:47:33,016
okay?And let's go back here. And we'll go

750
00:47:33,016 --> 00:47:35,576
back to channel content. And we have to

751
00:47:35,576 --> 00:47:37,896
look at Maximus Reximus as our pal.

752
00:47:42,296 --> 00:47:44,456
Oh ohh my goodness, look at that baby.

753
00:47:45,176 --> 00:47:47,656
Please like this one. Watch this one, I

754
00:47:47,656 --> 00:47:50,216
like it. Please. Pretty please.

755
00:47:50,616 --> 00:47:51,336
You okay?He

756
00:47:54,856 --> 00:47:57,816
is so cute. We love this dog so

757
00:47:57,896 --> 00:47:58,016
much.

758
00:48:08,696 --> 00:48:11,657
Oh, so awesome. Look at that. I love this

759
00:48:11,657 --> 00:48:13,577
little guy. I love that little

760
00:48:14,537 --> 00:48:17,417
guy. I love that little guy. I

761
00:48:17,497 --> 00:48:19,937
love him. I love my buddies.

762
00:48:23,377 --> 00:48:24,777
He's such a great pal. He's my

763
00:48:24,777 --> 00:48:27,577
grandfather, Harry. Anyway, we

764
00:48:29,577 --> 00:48:31,897
always watch something on YouTube. We are

765
00:48:31,897 --> 00:48:34,817
getting a lot more like... What's

766
00:48:34,817 --> 00:48:36,297
wrong?What happened?Meditative

767
00:48:37,577 --> 00:48:38,857
selections going.

768
00:48:41,977 --> 00:48:44,697
All right, so we did that and we want to

769
00:48:44,777 --> 00:48:47,737
get back to, and so that's Clearwater

770
00:48:47,737 --> 00:48:50,537
Cruising Ministries, of which I am a

771
00:48:50,537 --> 00:48:53,377
contributor. And my lovely Fifth

772
00:48:53,377 --> 00:48:55,457
Element is the

773
00:48:57,217 --> 00:48:58,537
proprietors of--

774
00:49:01,658 --> 00:49:03,738
all right. We want to go back here.

775
00:49:06,618 --> 00:49:08,938
If you're still with me, thank you. All

776
00:49:08,938 --> 00:49:11,818
right. And so here is a little bit of

777
00:49:11,978 --> 00:49:12,538
our

778
00:49:15,178 --> 00:49:17,258
journey inside of

779
00:49:19,578 --> 00:49:22,538
the pantry real quick. And

780
00:49:22,538 --> 00:49:24,498
we do actually sometimes use this because

781
00:49:24,498 --> 00:49:26,778
we are at the very edge of economic

782
00:49:27,098 --> 00:49:29,818
sustenance right now. I'm having a hard

783
00:49:29,818 --> 00:49:32,778
time with like my bandwidth here today.

784
00:49:33,978 --> 00:49:35,418
It's the reason why I'm not streaming.

785
00:49:35,418 --> 00:49:37,378
I'm actually recording this and uploading

786
00:49:37,378 --> 00:49:39,978
it. OK, that's not going to work

787
00:49:39,978 --> 00:49:41,738
probably right now. And I don't feel like

788
00:49:41,738 --> 00:49:44,618
digging deeper. But

789
00:49:44,618 --> 00:49:46,538
that was our pantry expedition.

790
00:49:48,578 --> 00:49:50,698
Um, and this is the taco,

791
00:49:51,418 --> 00:49:53,459
not the taco stand, but the

792
00:49:53,899 --> 00:49:56,379
most beautiful sunset

793
00:49:56,539 --> 00:49:59,019
ever with the most awesome,

794
00:49:59,659 --> 00:50:01,539
awesome um

795
00:50:01,979 --> 00:50:04,939
Southwest egg roll stand, egg roll truck.

796
00:50:04,939 --> 00:50:07,179
They're around the area, but they were

797
00:50:07,179 --> 00:50:10,139
there this night. And I really wish this

798
00:50:10,139 --> 00:50:10,939
would load.

799
00:50:13,979 --> 00:50:16,859
AhSo I dump

800
00:50:16,859 --> 00:50:19,059
them off my phone, and then they upload

801
00:50:19,179 --> 00:50:21,339
into Google Photos. And usually, they

802
00:50:21,339 --> 00:50:23,539
load pretty instantaneously. Maybe what's

803
00:50:24,099 --> 00:50:26,619
going on. Let's see.

804
00:50:36,439 --> 00:50:38,679
Davidas Music. Oh, love

805
00:50:38,999 --> 00:50:40,839
Davidas. I am Davidas.

806
00:50:42,199 --> 00:50:44,560
And he is on YouTube.

807
00:50:48,040 --> 00:50:50,680
And this guy's a local artist, and I love

808
00:50:50,680 --> 00:50:53,660
him. UmBut

809
00:50:53,660 --> 00:50:56,380
we got to check them out on YouTube here.

810
00:51:06,150 --> 00:51:07,910
Gotta close out some stuff.

811
00:51:22,850 --> 00:51:25,370
All right, so we closed out some stuff

812
00:51:25,410 --> 00:51:27,810
here. This is my private Discord clone in

813
00:51:27,810 --> 00:51:29,250
case anybody's been interested. I

814
00:51:29,250 --> 00:51:31,930
actually wrote this, and this is kind of

815
00:51:31,930 --> 00:51:34,891
a predecessor to this Angel OS in a

816
00:51:34,891 --> 00:51:37,141
way. This is a very

817
00:51:37,141 --> 00:51:39,221
sophisticated Discord clone, I might add.

818
00:51:39,221 --> 00:51:42,141
That also includes real-time video

819
00:51:42,141 --> 00:51:44,941
communication that you can actually--

820
00:51:45,901 --> 00:51:47,901
if I wasn't using my camera already, it

821
00:51:47,901 --> 00:51:50,661
would work. And I haven't gotten my other

822
00:51:50,661 --> 00:51:52,621
camera going here. But yeah, this is

823
00:51:52,621 --> 00:51:55,261
completely awesome in real

824
00:51:55,261 --> 00:51:58,061
time. And it runs on free

825
00:51:58,061 --> 00:52:01,021
software here. And right now,

826
00:52:01,581 --> 00:52:03,181
the last thing we were doing

827
00:52:05,941 --> 00:52:07,381
All right. We were trying to sell some

828
00:52:07,381 --> 00:52:09,541
philanthropy and some other stuff around

829
00:52:09,541 --> 00:52:11,981
the area. I think the main thing that we

830
00:52:11,981 --> 00:52:14,301
communicated and we're running up to like

831
00:52:14,301 --> 00:52:17,061
52 minutes or 53 minutes and

832
00:52:17,061 --> 00:52:19,221
53 is the new answer to the life universe

833
00:52:19,221 --> 00:52:21,581
and everything. I wanted to show some

834
00:52:21,581 --> 00:52:23,741
Strange Cloud stuff from earlier time. So

835
00:52:23,741 --> 00:52:25,421
main thing, I gave a shout out to Bianca

836
00:52:25,541 --> 00:52:27,542
from the Strange Clouds that we visited

837
00:52:27,542 --> 00:52:30,022
before and super grateful for that

838
00:52:30,062 --> 00:52:32,382
awesome in the bait, six milligram

839
00:52:33,822 --> 00:52:36,102
slushy flavor. That's so awesome. I love

840
00:52:36,142 --> 00:52:38,142
it. When I still vape, I'm trying to

841
00:52:38,142 --> 00:52:40,302
quit. And I didn't even vape once in this

842
00:52:40,382 --> 00:52:42,462
entire thing. All I can say is if you

843
00:52:42,462 --> 00:52:45,182
stuck with me, thank you. um If

844
00:52:45,262 --> 00:52:47,182
you have anything you want, I have tons

845
00:52:47,182 --> 00:52:49,342
of stuff I want to share, but the main

846
00:52:49,342 --> 00:52:51,662
thing was just that we had a great day

847
00:52:51,982 --> 00:52:54,862
with Harold and Kumar went to White

848
00:52:54,862 --> 00:52:57,262
Castle, only it was Ahmed and Kenneth

849
00:52:57,822 --> 00:53:00,542
went to John's Auto Service

850
00:53:00,862 --> 00:53:03,342
and Walmart. All right, guys.

851
00:53:03,742 --> 00:53:06,102
Thanks for watching. Like and subscribe.

852
00:53:06,302 --> 00:53:08,622
Seriously, and have a blessed day.
