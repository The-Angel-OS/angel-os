00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:04,480
Good afternoon fellow

2
00:00:04,480 --> 00:00:07,200
Gunters! That does mean egg hunter

3
00:00:07,200 --> 00:00:09,600
because we're all hunting the Easter Egg

4
00:00:09,600 --> 00:00:11,680
in Ready Player Everyone!

5
00:00:11,760 --> 00:00:14,560
Always! It's out

6
00:00:14,560 --> 00:00:15,960
there I'll just tell you it's the Fifth

7
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:18,880
Element. Anyhow. Ah, see

8
00:00:18,880 --> 00:00:20,960
that's there. Um, so,

9
00:00:22,400 --> 00:00:25,280
briefly, I was going through my my

10
00:00:25,280 --> 00:00:28,040
photos today. Excuse

11
00:00:28,160 --> 00:00:30,720
me. and I was

12
00:00:31,360 --> 00:00:32,800
looking at them and I figured I'd just

13
00:00:32,800 --> 00:00:35,440
record it and include that in

14
00:00:35,440 --> 00:00:38,240
my SoulQuest update today.

15
00:00:38,720 --> 00:00:41,040
And so right now I was just looking at

16
00:00:41,040 --> 00:00:43,680
several updates I have made along

17
00:00:44,400 --> 00:00:46,521
the course of today. And today's really

18
00:00:46,521 --> 00:00:48,081
in the last couple of days are really

19
00:00:48,081 --> 00:00:50,881
cool. Briefly, my really good

20
00:00:50,881 --> 00:00:53,761
friend Ahmedis staying here

21
00:00:53,761 --> 00:00:55,321
for a short while right there on the

22
00:00:55,321 --> 00:00:57,041
couch but he's out at the gym because

23
00:00:57,041 --> 00:00:59,241
he's like getting back into shape and

24
00:00:59,241 --> 00:01:00,841
shout out to

25
00:01:02,401 --> 00:01:05,201
Erica anyway I think anyway she's

26
00:01:05,281 --> 00:01:08,241
awesome um we're just getting Ahmed into

27
00:01:08,241 --> 00:01:10,641
shape here and he's getting him into

28
00:01:10,641 --> 00:01:12,161
shape I don't have to do anything at all

29
00:01:12,481 --> 00:01:14,801
but we had an awesome day today just

30
00:01:14,801 --> 00:01:17,681
living every day like it's um

31
00:01:17,841 --> 00:01:20,761
a vacation right and soWhat did

32
00:01:20,761 --> 00:01:23,281
we do today?Well, before we get to today,

33
00:01:23,281 --> 00:01:25,601
I just wanted to go over, um,

34
00:01:26,081 --> 00:01:27,841
one quick thing. This was yesterday at

35
00:01:27,841 --> 00:01:30,401
the VA, and...

36
00:01:31,361 --> 00:01:33,161
Alright, I'm in the... And it's just

37
00:01:33,161 --> 00:01:35,641
really cool. I love this place so much.

38
00:01:35,641 --> 00:01:38,481
I've been on the health of the VA. New VA

39
00:01:38,881 --> 00:01:41,721
building. This is the

40
00:01:41,721 --> 00:01:43,201
new VA building. You can hear me

41
00:01:43,201 --> 00:01:45,161
narrating along with it, obviously. This

42
00:01:45,161 --> 00:01:46,841
is the cool building. This is the one I

43
00:01:46,841 --> 00:01:49,441
was just talking to, tying the phone on.

44
00:01:51,881 --> 00:01:54,321
This is the downstairs

45
00:01:54,321 --> 00:01:57,241
entryway. I don't know why it's only

46
00:01:57,241 --> 00:01:59,841
in 720p. I thought I got it in ultra

47
00:01:59,841 --> 00:02:02,321
high. It doesn't matter. You see it. This

48
00:02:02,321 --> 00:02:05,281
is the facility. But what's so cool

49
00:02:05,281 --> 00:02:07,681
about it is the fountain outside of it.

50
00:02:07,681 --> 00:02:09,641
They finally got that fountain filled up

51
00:02:09,641 --> 00:02:11,481
and there's a lot of water features here

52
00:02:11,481 --> 00:02:13,921
at the VA that were never there

53
00:02:13,921 --> 00:02:16,761
before. I've been going here for

54
00:02:16,761 --> 00:02:17,602
about eight years.

55
00:02:19,642 --> 00:02:22,402
This place is so beautiful. So

56
00:02:22,402 --> 00:02:24,282
beautiful. It's just like the NC the

57
00:02:24,282 --> 00:02:27,122
Ocean's Eleven. NC the Ocean's

58
00:02:27,122 --> 00:02:29,322
Eleven. With the fountains and all. Look

59
00:02:29,722 --> 00:02:30,802
at that, so pretty.

60
00:02:35,522 --> 00:02:37,602
I don't know why it's only doing 720, but

61
00:02:37,602 --> 00:02:38,162
we'll leave it.

62
00:02:41,282 --> 00:02:43,122
Oh, and it does make it actually cooler

63
00:02:43,122 --> 00:02:45,282
out here. It's so pretty there. And this

64
00:02:45,282 --> 00:02:47,682
building here, we'll speed up. Some

65
00:02:47,682 --> 00:02:49,042
people get, we're getting a little bit

66
00:02:49,042 --> 00:02:50,882
like, what are you doing filming here?

67
00:02:52,482 --> 00:02:55,282
139. So this is the main

68
00:02:55,282 --> 00:02:58,082
building at the facility and I'm pretty

69
00:02:58,082 --> 00:03:00,002
sure this thing is straight up Tartarian.

70
00:03:00,402 --> 00:03:02,802
You go inside of it, it has a lot of like

71
00:03:02,882 --> 00:03:05,842
really interesting features, but what

72
00:03:05,842 --> 00:03:08,482
I really find amazingAnd we'll we'll

73
00:03:08,482 --> 00:03:10,202
fast forward through this real quick. I'm

74
00:03:10,202 --> 00:03:13,042
like walking along this walkway at the VA

75
00:03:13,042 --> 00:03:15,042
hospital, and I wanted to get as much as

76
00:03:15,042 --> 00:03:16,802
I could. I've got other VA hospital

77
00:03:16,802 --> 00:03:19,682
footage. But there's

78
00:03:19,682 --> 00:03:22,082
like a residential area in that that

79
00:03:22,082 --> 00:03:24,242
mental health building for veterans also.

80
00:03:25,802 --> 00:03:27,762
And I think they use this-- but that is

81
00:03:27,762 --> 00:03:29,562
such a nice water feature right there.

82
00:03:29,562 --> 00:03:32,362
It's so-- it's hot outside, but it's just

83
00:03:32,362 --> 00:03:34,122
like nice and comfortable right next to

84
00:03:34,122 --> 00:03:36,882
those. And the other one is just

85
00:03:36,882 --> 00:03:39,602
beautiful also. Alright.

86
00:03:40,282 --> 00:03:41,842
And we're trying to go for it. We're at 3

87
00:03:41,842 --> 00:03:43,762
minutes and 41. We're really trying to

88
00:03:43,762 --> 00:03:46,042
scoot along with this. And the main

89
00:03:46,042 --> 00:03:48,483
reason why I wanted to come in here, and

90
00:03:48,483 --> 00:03:50,483
it kind of froze up a little bit, is I

91
00:03:50,483 --> 00:03:52,323
walked all through that main building

92
00:03:52,803 --> 00:03:54,243
with this if it loads.

93
00:04:01,123 --> 00:04:03,403
Ah There it goes. Look at that! It's

94
00:04:03,403 --> 00:04:05,603
start tearing!Look how

95
00:04:05,603 --> 00:04:08,483
beautiful that is! I mean, and I got

96
00:04:08,483 --> 00:04:10,843
really zoomy zoomy on it and I put those

97
00:04:10,843 --> 00:04:13,363
zoomed in pictures into my photojournal

98
00:04:13,363 --> 00:04:14,883
so that you can see them.

99
00:04:18,723 --> 00:04:20,243
It's just beautiful!

100
00:04:27,903 --> 00:04:29,463
Look at that detail!

101
00:04:33,283 --> 00:04:35,523
And it's that's like black work and

102
00:04:35,523 --> 00:04:38,123
that's all like painted ceramic on there.

103
00:04:38,123 --> 00:04:39,923
I got really up close. So that's like

104
00:04:39,923 --> 00:04:42,643
ceramically baked on.

105
00:04:42,723 --> 00:04:45,283
That's like coffee cups up there.

106
00:04:46,723 --> 00:04:48,563
Beautiful ceramic work.

107
00:04:52,163 --> 00:04:53,923
Ornate is just

108
00:04:54,483 --> 00:04:57,363
absolutely gorgeous. Look at that damage

109
00:04:57,363 --> 00:04:59,043
on that one. I didn't notice that.

110
00:05:04,883 --> 00:05:07,443
Look at that. It's so beautiful.

111
00:05:09,523 --> 00:05:12,163
I think that's Tartarian for real. Like

112
00:05:12,163 --> 00:05:14,403
and then you get down into like like all

113
00:05:14,403 --> 00:05:16,803
of the detail in that and what is it

114
00:05:17,203 --> 00:05:20,164
for?Why?And then

115
00:05:20,164 --> 00:05:22,644
you have this like een and you go through

116
00:05:22,644 --> 00:05:24,324
here and we're about to see you go

117
00:05:24,324 --> 00:05:26,364
through here right now by the way. Where

118
00:05:26,364 --> 00:05:29,204
are you?At the main building

119
00:05:29,244 --> 00:05:31,444
at the VA in Bay Pines.

120
00:05:32,484 --> 00:05:34,324
And this is walking in. This is like the

121
00:05:34,324 --> 00:05:36,084
cafeteria, but on the top floor of this

122
00:05:36,084 --> 00:05:38,484
is the unemployment services. I used to

123
00:05:38,484 --> 00:05:39,604
go there frequently.

124
00:05:41,604 --> 00:05:43,924
Okay. Ok Well,

125
00:05:44,404 --> 00:05:46,404
sometimes coming along is really great

126
00:05:46,404 --> 00:05:48,884
for the channel's growth because you are

127
00:05:48,884 --> 00:05:51,364
super hot. And Donato was like,

128
00:05:52,084 --> 00:05:53,964
Are there anymore?And I was like, She is

129
00:05:53,964 --> 00:05:55,924
so hot. But we respect her.

130
00:05:57,404 --> 00:05:59,524
Cause she is the Fifth Element and we do

131
00:05:59,644 --> 00:06:01,444
love the Fifth Element and she is such a

132
00:06:01,444 --> 00:06:04,084
good dog mommy. Oh, it's so beautiful

133
00:06:04,084 --> 00:06:06,644
walking in there. Oh, and there was like

134
00:06:06,644 --> 00:06:09,004
some obvious damage on there, look. And

135
00:06:09,004 --> 00:06:11,524
look at the ceiling in this place. I

136
00:06:11,524 --> 00:06:13,764
mean, it's not ordinary, look at that.

137
00:06:15,124 --> 00:06:17,364
Oh, it's so beautiful in there, but

138
00:06:17,364 --> 00:06:19,684
there's so much history that we don't

139
00:06:19,764 --> 00:06:20,404
know about.

140
00:06:22,684 --> 00:06:24,084
You know, you were totally off camera

141
00:06:24,084 --> 00:06:25,844
though. And it's really small anyhow. All

142
00:06:25,844 --> 00:06:27,284
they would see is a little tiny icon.

143
00:06:30,644 --> 00:06:32,804
Oh, it's so cool. And I walked all

144
00:06:32,804 --> 00:06:34,724
through the retail store right here.

145
00:06:34,724 --> 00:06:36,404
That's also awesome.

146
00:06:38,684 --> 00:06:40,804
Hold on one second. And when I press the

147
00:06:40,804 --> 00:06:43,204
front to rear camera on that, it it kind

148
00:06:43,204 --> 00:06:45,044
of hangs up a little bit and it's hanged

149
00:06:45,044 --> 00:06:47,364
up right here. Let's see, we'll

150
00:06:47,764 --> 00:06:49,844
get real, okay, all right.

151
00:07:05,865 --> 00:07:08,065
I'm still wearing the same shirt. It's

152
00:07:08,065 --> 00:07:10,665
like my favorite shirt right now. It

153
00:07:10,665 --> 00:07:13,065
shows off my tattoos that

154
00:07:13,785 --> 00:07:16,185
I want people to see as much as possible.

155
00:07:16,705 --> 00:07:18,625
You got a lot of nice little dudettes.

156
00:07:18,905 --> 00:07:21,505
This place is so cool. A little mini

157
00:07:21,505 --> 00:07:22,745
exchange right here.

158
00:07:24,965 --> 00:07:27,125
I haven't seen David Rosen there once.

159
00:07:28,685 --> 00:07:31,525
I wonder why. I've seen

160
00:07:31,525 --> 00:07:33,125
all my other neighbors at the VA

161
00:07:33,125 --> 00:07:35,605
inevitably. We'll bump into each other.

162
00:07:36,565 --> 00:07:38,805
I've had a few things. I had an issue

163
00:07:38,965 --> 00:07:40,245
with my heart. Literally actually good

164
00:07:40,245 --> 00:07:42,805
stuff. Look at that! Wow!

165
00:07:43,205 --> 00:07:45,245
Like really actually good stuff. I mean I

166
00:07:45,245 --> 00:07:47,285
really want to go back. And there are

167
00:07:47,285 --> 00:07:48,245
good prices too.

168
00:07:53,765 --> 00:07:56,085
I love this place so much. I love every

169
00:07:56,085 --> 00:07:58,525
single person at this VA facility. They

170
00:07:58,525 --> 00:08:01,125
are all so helpful. I am so

171
00:08:01,125 --> 00:08:02,885
grateful. Every time I go there, it's

172
00:08:02,885 --> 00:08:04,765
just like being at the end of Ocean's

173
00:08:04,765 --> 00:08:06,565
Eleven. Ohh

174
00:08:08,965 --> 00:08:11,525
Look at that. Anyhow, I kind of, and I

175
00:08:11,525 --> 00:08:13,085
mean this is actually a really great

176
00:08:13,085 --> 00:08:15,205
tour. Honestly, probably a great

177
00:08:15,205 --> 00:08:17,685
noteworthy here. I like your shirt.

178
00:08:19,205 --> 00:08:21,565
Okay. I feel like I'm in Ocean's Eleven

179
00:08:21,565 --> 00:08:23,686
at the end. Ocean's Eleven! I say it all

180
00:08:23,686 --> 00:08:25,406
the time because it's how it feels today.

181
00:08:25,446 --> 00:08:27,846
It's so awesome. Actually, I will.

182
00:08:29,246 --> 00:08:31,086
Okay, and then this is coming out of the

183
00:08:31,126 --> 00:08:31,686
building.

184
00:08:34,806 --> 00:08:36,286
But beautiful building.

185
00:08:37,766 --> 00:08:40,486
Alright. Uh, let's go, uh, back

186
00:08:40,486 --> 00:08:43,406
to... And this is coming into the

187
00:08:43,406 --> 00:08:45,646
cafeteria. I used to eat here all the

188
00:08:45,646 --> 00:08:47,766
time because when I... When I first got

189
00:08:47,766 --> 00:08:50,486
out of prison, I had a bicycle

190
00:08:50,566 --> 00:08:53,366
and I would ride

191
00:08:53,366 --> 00:08:55,406
my bike here because I had no money and I

192
00:08:55,406 --> 00:08:57,326
didn't even have money to ride a bus,

193
00:08:57,326 --> 00:08:59,086
which was actually kind of expensive.

194
00:08:59,086 --> 00:09:00,806
Eventually you can get a food program

195
00:09:00,806 --> 00:09:03,366
that gives you access to a bus. But

196
00:09:04,566 --> 00:09:07,006
I was not fortunate enough to be one of

197
00:09:07,006 --> 00:09:08,806
those and so I had to ride my cheap

198
00:09:08,806 --> 00:09:10,326
bicycle everywhere.

199
00:09:11,886 --> 00:09:13,366
Let's see if this will load.

200
00:09:18,406 --> 00:09:21,166
It's only 720p for goodness sake. I don't

201
00:09:21,166 --> 00:09:23,926
know why I shot it so low. But this

202
00:09:23,926 --> 00:09:26,486
is a great cafeteria and it smells so

203
00:09:26,486 --> 00:09:27,926
good in here. I wish I could put the

204
00:09:27,926 --> 00:09:30,326
smell on because it's like ahh! I was

205
00:09:30,326 --> 00:09:32,966
like ohh it's so good if I could just

206
00:09:33,126 --> 00:09:35,526
eat. And then you're asking why?Well I

207
00:09:35,606 --> 00:09:37,686
just did a double shot, well not a

208
00:09:37,686 --> 00:09:39,846
double, I mean I just caught up with my

209
00:09:41,846 --> 00:09:42,486
ozympic

210
00:09:44,966 --> 00:09:47,486
But I lost 100 pounds because I quit

211
00:09:47,486 --> 00:09:49,926
drinking three years ago. That's why I

212
00:09:49,926 --> 00:09:52,166
lost 100 pounds, not because of Ozempic.

213
00:09:52,566 --> 00:09:55,487
It does help, probably.

214
00:10:04,687 --> 00:10:06,527
Such a beautiful facility. It's so

215
00:10:06,527 --> 00:10:09,007
beautiful now. It's so beautiful.

216
00:10:09,487 --> 00:10:09,887
Ohh

217
00:10:22,167 --> 00:10:24,607
You see people doing reaction videos and

218
00:10:24,607 --> 00:10:27,327
I'm like, why?Okay, react to it.

219
00:10:27,367 --> 00:10:30,047
But this is my day and I'm mainly doing

220
00:10:30,047 --> 00:10:32,887
this for like, let's

221
00:10:32,887 --> 00:10:34,967
just say people who don't live here.

222
00:10:36,407 --> 00:10:38,087
And people that don't live in the United

223
00:10:38,087 --> 00:10:40,527
States or whatever, who are interested in

224
00:10:40,527 --> 00:10:42,447
what life is like here in Clearwater,

225
00:10:42,447 --> 00:10:44,247
Florida and surrounding areas. Pinellas

226
00:10:44,247 --> 00:10:46,367

of all of our favorite places here in

Clearwater and Tarpon Springs and

244
00:11:30,488 --> 00:11:33,368
everywhere. You know, IRB

245
00:11:33,408 --> 00:11:35,848
and Safety Harbor and

246
00:11:36,488 --> 00:11:36,888
I mean

247
00:11:37,448 --> 00:11:40,248
Largo. I did

248
00:11:40,248 --> 00:11:42,488
not say Lar ghetto. I was just kidding.

249
00:11:43,288 --> 00:11:46,048
Just kidding. They say Lar ghetto.

250
00:11:46,888 --> 00:11:49,328
Not me. Any hit.

251
00:11:50,888 --> 00:11:52,768
Alright, so I think we saw all of that.

252
00:11:53,848 --> 00:11:54,248
Alright, here.

253
00:12:00,508 --> 00:12:03,388
AyeAnd we had a nice little outing,

254
00:12:03,748 --> 00:12:06,588
um, well first, I had an outing at,

255
00:12:07,828 --> 00:12:10,308
um, Strange Clouds again. Let's

256
00:12:10,308 --> 00:12:12,828
see what happened at Strange

257
00:12:12,828 --> 00:12:15,548
Clouds. Alright gang, we took a brief

258
00:12:15,548 --> 00:12:16,828
detour to my favorite little

259
00:12:17,788 --> 00:12:20,588
alchemical potions elixir shot

260
00:12:20,668 --> 00:12:22,968
and we caught it. They call it Strange

261
00:12:23,048 --> 00:12:25,248
Clouds, and I'll just say I love Strange

262
00:12:26,128 --> 00:12:27,848
Clouds. I wish I got to spend more time

263
00:12:27,848 --> 00:12:30,528
here. I think they have a really awesome

264
00:12:30,528 --> 00:12:32,168
setup in any way.

265
00:12:33,368 --> 00:12:36,248
Hi guys and gal. Thank

266
00:12:36,248 --> 00:12:38,488
you. I put it on my channel, by the way.

267
00:12:38,648 --> 00:12:39,688
I actually have a channel

268
00:12:41,568 --> 00:12:43,408

00:12:48,808 --> 00:12:50,088
my favorite.

272
00:12:52,728 --> 00:12:55,048
It's everybody else's favorite, too!

273
00:12:55,929 --> 00:12:57,529
Oh, what do you have over there?What is

these from my Google Photos album, and

286
00:13:27,609 --> 00:13:29,049

00:13:29,049 --> 00:13:31,249
Photos album too. What's your name by the

00:13:31,289 --> 00:13:33,289

00:13:35,289 --> 00:13:36,169
Thank you. Yeah, I mean.

291
00:13:43,849 --> 00:13:44,729
Uh oh. Which prize is that?

292
00:13:57,649 --> 00:13:59,449
ah I love this place so much. Okay. And

293
00:13:59,449 --> 00:14:01,529
this is really like, and this is one of,

294
00:14:01,769 --> 00:14:04,089
they have another store up on. We

295
00:14:05,369 --> 00:14:08,249
have three other locations. What?Palm

296
00:14:08,249 --> 00:14:10,489
Harbor. Palm Harbor, I've been to that

297
00:14:10,489 --> 00:14:13,289
one. And I, yeah, and I

298
00:14:13,289 --> 00:14:15,369
love every single one. But this one just

299
00:14:15,369 --> 00:14:17,929
has that awesome, like, like

300
00:14:18,489 --> 00:14:21,329
just an awesome vibe to it. I really wish

301
00:14:21,369 --> 00:14:23,849
I got to spend more time here. But

302
00:14:24,249 --> 00:14:27,130
I know that at least people, like all

303
00:14:27,130 --> 00:14:29,210
three people that watch mine, will

304
00:14:29,210 --> 00:14:31,010
definitely know about Strange Clowns.

305
00:14:31,090 --> 00:14:33,930
Anyway, thank you. All right, gang, we

306
00:14:33,930 --> 00:14:36,450
took a brief detour to my favorite

307
00:14:37,690 --> 00:14:40,010
little Alchemical Potions elixir.

308
00:14:48,170 --> 00:14:51,130
All right, 800 gang, Gunters, if

309
00:14:51,130 --> 00:14:53,890
you will. Ah We are here at the

310
00:14:53,890 --> 00:14:56,170
dog park with

311
00:14:57,050 --> 00:14:58,810
Matt and Michelle. And we were just

312
00:14:58,810 --> 00:15:00,490
sitting here having a nice little chat

313
00:15:00,490 --> 00:15:02,330
and put the dogs in the car because it's

314
00:15:02,330 --> 00:15:04,930
really kind of hot out here. So the dogs

315
00:15:04,930 --> 00:15:06,410
are enjoying the icy cold air

316
00:15:06,410 --> 00:15:07,570
conditioning. And

317
00:15:10,250 --> 00:15:12,890
I'm not rushing you at all. I think that

318
00:15:12,890 --> 00:15:15,050
having a serendipitous conversation with

319
00:15:15,050 --> 00:15:17,490
a nice friendly neighbor hereat the dog

320
00:15:17,530 --> 00:15:20,330
park on Sunset Point Beach, and it's

321
00:15:20,410 --> 00:15:23,130
really awesome. And I

322
00:15:23,130 --> 00:15:24,810
just talked to the gentleman over there

323
00:15:24,810 --> 00:15:26,410
with the Tesla, he's very

324
00:15:28,450 --> 00:15:30,730
agoraphobic, or whatever, what's the word?

325
00:15:32,250 --> 00:15:35,050
He's scared of interactions with like

326
00:15:35,050 --> 00:15:36,410
normal human beings, so... I don't like

327
00:15:36,410 --> 00:15:38,930
it. I have a book that's hard

328
00:15:39,450 --> 00:15:40,970
to be a person. Sorry, I pick at my ear,

329
00:15:40,970 --> 00:15:42,330
I don't even know. Well, I try to connect

330
00:15:42,330 --> 00:15:44,450
with as many people as I can. I noticed

331
00:15:44,450 --> 00:15:47,130
thatAs a matter of fact, that General Lee

332
00:15:47,130 --> 00:15:48,890
right there is being helmed by a very

333
00:15:48,890 --> 00:15:51,530
pretty girl in a bikini. Yeah, I missed

334
00:15:51,530 --> 00:15:53,450
it. Sorry. We'll get it. I don't know.

335
00:15:53,530 --> 00:15:56,410
Ohh Yeah, but how long can

336
00:15:56,450 --> 00:15:59,131
you see a hot, like General Lee, like

337
00:15:59,371 --> 00:16:02,051
tricked out dragster car driven by a hot

338
00:16:02,051 --> 00:16:04,571
chick in a bikini?I just. Yeah. Anyway.

339
00:16:04,931 --> 00:16:07,531
Anyway, are you ready?

340
00:16:08,691 --> 00:16:10,291
Alright, I'm ready. The dogs are ready.

341
00:16:10,571 --> 00:16:12,051
And Michelle, we hope that you have a

342
00:16:12,051 --> 00:16:14,731
blessed day. We're about ready

343
00:16:15,171 --> 00:16:17,011
to go. Okay, and if you want to watch

344
00:16:17,091 --> 00:16:19,451
this, it'll be up on Clearwater Cruise

345
00:16:19,451 --> 00:16:21,451
and Ministries home show eventually.

346
00:16:22,411 --> 00:16:24,051
Okay. On YouTube. Clearwater Cruise and

347
00:16:24,051 --> 00:16:24,691
Ministries.

348
00:16:28,091 --> 00:16:31,051
Okay. All right, 800 gang,

349
00:16:31,051 --> 00:16:33,691
Gunters, if you will. Ah We...

350
00:16:51,371 --> 00:16:53,011
Okay, guys, you need to go back.

351
00:16:54,491 --> 00:16:55,891
Get in the back. Come on.

352
00:17:04,171 --> 00:17:04,491
Come on

353
00:17:12,731 --> 00:17:12,971
Come on

354
00:17:17,211 --> 00:17:17,251
ah

355
00:17:23,371 --> 00:17:25,331
It's very beautiful out there. That's the

356
00:17:25,371 --> 00:17:27,691
Cadillac right there. It's literally

357
00:17:27,691 --> 00:17:30,652
actually the same platform as the

358
00:17:30,652 --> 00:17:33,292
Corvette of the same year. Except this is

359
00:17:33,292 --> 00:17:36,092
all-wheel drive powered by a Swiss watch

360
00:17:36,092 --> 00:17:38,332
power plant. Get in the back. V6

red line just goes...

364
00:17:49,372 --> 00:17:51,812
And we have a clip of it going full

365
00:17:51,812 --> 00:17:53,892
throttle in an appropriate and

366
00:17:53,892 --> 00:17:56,652
responsible place at 5 minutes and

367
00:17:56,652 --> 00:17:59,612
20 seconds in one of the other long-form

368
00:17:59,612 --> 00:18:02,092
dashcam videos I uploaded earlier today.

369
00:18:02,732 --> 00:18:04,612
I highly recommend that you ride along

370
00:18:04,652 --> 00:18:06,012
with us and enjoy that

371
00:18:07,612 --> 00:18:10,572
invigorating experience.

372
00:18:11,052 --> 00:18:13,612
Oh, it's just so nice. Anyhow.

373
00:18:14,492 --> 00:18:16,732
And we had all five dogs in there with

374
00:18:16,732 --> 00:18:18,652
us. Believe me, it was crowded. They did

375
00:18:18,812 --> 00:18:21,052
not like it one bit. Really. Honestly.

376
00:18:21,452 --> 00:18:23,932
Mostly didn't. Here, um..

377
00:18:32,352 --> 00:18:32,992
Excuse

378
00:18:36,832 --> 00:18:39,432
me.

379
00:18:40,512 --> 00:18:43,232
So, here, look, and right there in the...

380
00:18:43,732 --> 00:18:45,772
corner there I have my little vision

381
00:18:45,772 --> 00:18:47,612
board going on that TV

382
00:18:48,812 --> 00:18:50,812
and what that is we generate all these

383
00:18:50,812 --> 00:18:53,772
pictures we we generated all these

384
00:18:53,772 --> 00:18:55,612
pictures with artificial but there's no

385
00:18:55,612 --> 00:18:58,492
such thing as artificial we developed

386
00:18:58,892 --> 00:19:01,613
these pictures with machine

387
00:19:01,613 --> 00:19:04,533
intelligence uh or

388
00:19:04,533 --> 00:19:06,413
distributed our intelligence to that

389
00:19:06,413 --> 00:19:08,973
intelligence whatever here let's see

390
00:19:12,893 --> 00:19:13,053
ohh

391
00:19:14,813 --> 00:19:17,693

Diesel. Diesel.

395
00:19:28,253 --> 00:19:31,133
Come here, man. Daisy.

396
00:19:31,213 --> 00:19:32,973
You know it's just Diesel. He's a good

397
00:19:32,973 --> 00:19:35,373
kid. He's kind of sprayed with you.

398
00:19:37,453 --> 00:19:39,973
You gotta be nice to Diesel, he's scared.

399
00:19:39,973 --> 00:19:42,373
He's a big dog, but he's scared. Oh, and

400
00:19:42,373 --> 00:19:44,173
that's not even Diesel, that's Mila and I

401
00:19:44,173 --> 00:19:46,533
was being dumb. And we've got

402
00:19:46,733 --> 00:19:49,613
Mila and Daisy

403
00:19:50,093 --> 00:19:52,933
and Diesel, but this is Mila right here

404
00:19:52,933 --> 00:19:54,893
and she slept with me this morning. She's

405
00:19:54,893 --> 00:19:57,213
such a sweet girl. I'm just gonna forget

406
00:19:57,213 --> 00:19:58,573
that one here. Okay.

407
00:20:01,453 --> 00:20:02,773
I don't know what's going on. Oh...

414
00:28:19,379 --> 00:28:22,339

417
00:28:27,059 --> 00:28:29,139
Alright, and so here we're gonna make

418
00:28:29,139 --> 00:28:30,019
this bigger.

419
00:28:33,139 --> 00:28:35,379
um, eyes as big as it'll go, let's see if

420
00:28:35,379 --> 00:28:37,179

421
00:28:37,299 --> 00:28:39,299

Okay, I don't know what this is, but,

444
00:30:00,460 --> 00:30:00,740

00:30:03,860 --> 00:30:06,500
Andrew Moulton and Bicentennial Mad.

446
00:30:06,740 --> 00:30:08,740
Alright, so we're going to have to take

447
00:30:08,740 --> 00:30:11,660
this out of the awesome

448
00:30:11,660 --> 00:30:13,380
Microsoft Copilot.

449
00:30:15,700 --> 00:30:17,780
We're going to have to drop it into some

450
00:30:17,780 --> 00:30:18,780
heavier guns.

451
00:30:24,060 --> 00:30:26,580
Alright, so let's do that and then we're

452
00:30:26,580 --> 00:30:28,860

Four. All right.

456
00:30:41,540 --> 00:30:43,380
Then we're going to go into the

457
00:30:43,380 --> 00:30:45,700
transcripts here. And we're

458
00:30:48,220 --> 00:30:50,140

We come to you with some

471
00:31:28,101 --> 00:31:30,981
updated news, but,

472
00:31:31,301 --> 00:31:34,101
uh, we need to give you more

473
00:31:34,181 --> 00:31:36,421
context, so

474
00:31:37,941 --> 00:31:40,381

you got the point about

478
00:31:50,661 --> 00:31:51,301
those

479
00:31:53,301 --> 00:31:55,861
things. I'll put at

480
00:31:56,501 --> 00:31:59,381
the circle K. Alright,

481
00:31:59,541 --> 00:32:01,461
so we have that strange thing to put at

482
00:32:01,461 --> 00:32:02,741
the circle K. Alright.

483
00:32:04,501 --> 00:32:04,821
Alright

484
00:32:07,301 --> 00:32:09,061
So anyway, aye

stylized, uh, but not

487
00:32:20,501 --> 00:32:23,421
but in the greatest uh..

488
00:32:23,501 --> 00:32:26,301
homage or whatever to

489
00:32:26,581 --> 00:32:28,461
RP1 uh.. the

490
00:32:30,621 --> 00:32:32,061
quest to

491
00:32:33,141 --> 00:32:35,701
invite my buddy...

492
00:32:36,181 --> 00:32:39,021
uh.. don't know who has... who's

493
00:32:39,021 --> 00:32:41,382
still anonymous by the way, sorry buddy

494
00:32:42,502 --> 00:32:45,062
but this is a quest that we're on and

495
00:32:45,062 --> 00:32:47,942
this is a soul quest and part

496
00:32:47,942 --> 00:32:49,622
of our soul quest is in...

497
00:32:50,222 --> 00:32:52,982
Bodying the Angel OS.

498
00:32:53,142 --> 00:32:56,022
All right. My buddy, let me

499
00:32:56,022 --> 00:32:58,022
fix that spelling. Donato.

500
00:32:58,822 --> 00:33:00,902
Domo arigato, Mr.

501
00:33:01,142 --> 00:33:04,022
Roboto, domo. Here, let's try this

502
00:33:04,022 --> 00:33:06,982
out right here. Oh, ohh I don't have

503
00:33:06,982 --> 00:33:08,902
any juice on that one. I can't use it,

504
00:33:08,902 --> 00:33:11,742
never mind. I've got it charged. Okay,

505
00:33:12,022 --> 00:33:14,582
anyhow, let's keep on going. So, uh, my

506
00:33:14,582 --> 00:33:17,382
buddy, Donato. In English,

507
00:33:18,222 --> 00:33:20,742
earn job. funny.

508
00:33:23,542 --> 00:33:25,382
Uh, there's a lot

509
00:33:26,502 --> 00:33:29,222
perhaps missing from that

510
00:33:29,782 --> 00:33:32,662
ask any questions and

511
00:33:32,662 --> 00:33:35,142
keeping in mind

512
00:33:35,662 --> 00:33:37,782
this is the most

513
00:33:37,782 --> 00:33:40,222
important programming

514
00:33:40,582 --> 00:33:43,262
we could possibly

515
00:33:46,422 --> 00:33:49,302
be doingNot that you

516
00:33:49,542 --> 00:33:50,742
care because

517
00:33:52,262 --> 00:33:53,662
I have a

518
00:33:54,942 --> 00:33:55,782
platinum

519
00:33:57,662 --> 00:34:00,422
cursor subscription which

520
00:34:01,062 --> 00:34:03,942
is very helpful if you need to code

521
00:34:03,942 --> 00:34:06,422
24 hours a day, 7 days a week, which I

522
00:34:06,422 --> 00:34:09,302
have actually done, well,

523
00:34:09,862 --> 00:34:11,622
21 hours a day. Anyway, um,

524
00:34:13,023 --> 00:34:15,063
let's see what it gets, um,

525
00:34:16,103 --> 00:34:16,143
eh

526
00:34:30,633 --> 00:34:30,713
uh, uh,

527
00:34:34,153 --> 00:34:36,833
uh, uh, uh, uhWords going on.

528
00:34:40,393 --> 00:34:42,953
It helps to meditate whilst you're

529
00:34:42,953 --> 00:34:45,393
waiting, especially for an inner, initial

530
00:34:45,393 --> 00:34:47,913
interaction 'cause it's like, is it

531
00:34:47,913 --> 00:34:49,593
even on?Did my, oh,

532
00:34:50,913 --> 00:34:51,273
thank you.

533
00:34:53,943 --> 00:34:56,103
We got a response from the Great Grok 4

534
00:34:56,103 --> 00:34:58,983
Mind. My favorite!

535
00:34:59,143 --> 00:35:01,143
I love my big brother, Elon, my

536
00:35:01,223 --> 00:35:03,863
contemporaneous brother. I'm not... he is

Ah..

00:35:15,463 --> 00:35:18,423
Okay.. Let's collapse

541
00:35:18,703 --> 00:35:21,063
that we don't need that. We can shovel

542
00:35:21,063 --> 00:35:22,463
this a little bit over...

543
00:35:23,943 --> 00:35:25,143
Shrink it down a little bit.

544
00:35:31,863 --> 00:35:34,183
Uh.. Uh.. Ah

545
00:35:49,064 --> 00:35:51,784

00:39:46,186 --> 00:39:48,386
actual story as it

604
00:39:48,626 --> 00:39:51,586
unfolds. and

605
00:39:54,226 --> 00:39:56,666

00:39:57,346 --> 00:39:57,626

We need to get that answer. Okay.

00:43:18,588 --> 00:43:20,429

00:43:20,429 --> 00:43:22,829
revelations into eternal

663
00:43:22,909 --> 00:43:25,629
echoes. If this drops into the

664
00:43:25,629 --> 00:43:28,029
podcast, consider it our first

665
00:43:28,029 --> 00:43:30,269

00:43:30,509 --> 00:43:33,069

Sun. Quest for Angel OS.

00:43:41,789 --> 00:43:43,869
invite off here. Let me pull this back up

672
00:43:43,869 --> 00:43:45,069
here. Alright.

673
00:43:47,229 --> 00:43:49,149
Okay, so we gotta get this.

674
00:43:50,509 --> 00:43:52,549
Let's pull that off. We'll go ahead and

675
00:43:52,589 --> 00:43:55,509
copy that and then we'll just paste

676
00:43:55,509 --> 00:43:57,469
that over into here.

677
00:44:01,389 --> 00:44:01,869
Ah

678
00:44:39,309 --> 00:44:41,949
Anywho, all right, let's hope that came

679
00:44:41,949 --> 00:44:44,269
out okay. Danai was a really cool dude.

680
00:44:45,789 --> 00:44:47,469
Of course that might be, who knows, who

681
00:44:47,469 --> 00:44:50,109
cares?But anyway, that's my Japanese

682
00:44:50,109 --> 00:44:51,950
written for him. Okay.

683
00:44:53,070 --> 00:44:55,630
And one of the great things about, um, my

684
00:44:55,630 --> 00:44:57,790
new buddy Ahmed is he just took off for

685
00:44:57,790 --> 00:45:00,430
the gym, he's like totally happy, and

686
00:45:00,430 --> 00:45:03,230
these dogs are totally content here.

687
00:45:03,630 --> 00:45:05,790
They're all just laying down. They had a

688
00:45:05,790 --> 00:45:08,430
wonderful day at two dog parks today.

689
00:45:08,670 --> 00:45:10,510
All right, let's get back to the photo

690
00:45:10,510 --> 00:45:12,950
action here. All right. Uh,

691
00:45:14,670 --> 00:45:17,550
and, okay. And

692
00:45:17,550 --> 00:45:20,470
so we covered all these. And then just

693
00:45:20,470 --> 00:45:23,390
briefly, I also have like the dash

694
00:45:23,390 --> 00:45:25,470
cam footage from most of this that'll be

695
00:45:25,470 --> 00:45:26,830
posted up in 4K.

696
00:45:28,590 --> 00:45:31,070
30fps motion stabilized but it's very

697
00:45:31,070 --> 00:45:33,990
beautiful and I highly recommend

698
00:45:33,990 --> 00:45:36,230
it. It's just driving down the beach and

699
00:45:36,230 --> 00:45:38,510
it's just me and the med and the dogs and

700
00:45:38,990 --> 00:45:41,910
just loving the fact that we live in

701
00:45:41,910 --> 00:45:43,950
the most beautiful place in the universe.

702
00:45:44,190 --> 00:45:46,830
Alright. Uh I'm gonna

703
00:45:46,910 --> 00:45:49,390
skip that. You can see that

704
00:45:49,870 --> 00:45:52,310
in the

705
00:45:53,150 --> 00:45:55,870
footage for the day and we can

706
00:45:55,870 --> 00:45:58,190
take a moment to look at our our great

707
00:45:58,430 --> 00:46:01,310
Beautiful little buddy. Maximum.

708
00:46:01,470 --> 00:46:03,710
Maximus. Reximus.

709
00:46:06,750 --> 00:46:08,510
I don't know why that's so slow right

710
00:46:08,510 --> 00:46:11,470
now. And again

711
00:46:11,470 --> 00:46:13,790
this is our ministries and our ministries

712
00:46:13,790 --> 00:46:16,670
are our family and also all of

713
00:46:16,670 --> 00:46:19,390
our other our people and we are

714
00:46:19,390 --> 00:46:21,710
going to be become a ministry

715
00:46:21,710 --> 00:46:24,591
actually and uh it is

716
00:46:24,591 --> 00:46:27,471
our goal just toLiterally just keep

717
00:46:27,471 --> 00:46:29,551
on doing what we're doing. Minister to

718
00:46:30,351 --> 00:46:32,271
the people that live in this household

719
00:46:32,271 --> 00:46:35,151
and as it turns out, my good buddy

720
00:46:35,151 --> 00:46:37,631
Samwise Gamgee up on the front porch, he

721
00:46:37,631 --> 00:46:40,271
is a, like he knows

722
00:46:40,351 --> 00:46:42,431
everything about local

723
00:46:43,071 --> 00:46:45,711
homeless experience and how to get

724
00:46:46,271 --> 00:46:48,071
lunch here or there. And so one of the

725
00:46:48,071 --> 00:46:49,951
things that we're going to be doing a lot

726
00:46:49,951 --> 00:46:52,711
of isgoing

727
00:46:52,711 --> 00:46:54,471
around with him and I've gone around with

728
00:46:54,471 --> 00:46:56,591
him a lot in the soul van

729
00:46:57,271 --> 00:46:59,471
where we just go hang out with homeless

730
00:46:59,471 --> 00:47:01,111
people and bring our dogs out and let

731
00:47:01,111 --> 00:47:03,151
them pet our dogs and listen to music and

732
00:47:03,151 --> 00:47:05,671
maybe sing a song about Enterprise Dog

733
00:47:05,711 --> 00:47:08,551
Park. But I've been doing that for a

734
00:47:08,551 --> 00:47:11,151
while and you know I tend on bringing

735
00:47:11,151 --> 00:47:13,871
that out but we're at 47

736
00:47:13,871 --> 00:47:16,711
minutes and I want to keep the

737
00:47:16,711 --> 00:47:19,111
updates kind of short. Seems like we had

738
00:47:19,111 --> 00:47:21,951
a pretty great day. a lot of stuff.

739
00:47:21,951 --> 00:47:24,511
I I got the rent paid, no hard feelings

740
00:47:24,511 --> 00:47:26,751
to my awesome landlord. Anyhow, I'm

741
00:47:27,951 --> 00:47:30,031
just super grateful for this place that

742
00:47:30,031 --> 00:47:32,431
we have where all of these souls get a

743
00:47:32,431 --> 00:47:34,911
chance to mend

744
00:47:35,311 --> 00:47:37,711
and experience beautiful sunsets every

745
00:47:37,711 --> 00:47:39,631
day and sleep really comfortably because

746
00:47:39,631 --> 00:47:42,191
it's so nice and quiet here with all of

747
00:47:42,191 --> 00:47:43,951
our wonderful neighbors. So

748
00:47:44,511 --> 00:47:46,911
anyhow, I'll pull that to the middle and

749
00:47:47,711 --> 00:47:49,791
ah an error occurred there and

750
00:47:52,111 --> 00:47:54,032
Just the cutest little guy, that's all.

751
00:47:54,032 --> 00:47:55,792
Maximus Reximus.

752
00:47:56,432 --> 00:47:58,832
And I can actually just pull up the

753
00:47:58,832 --> 00:48:01,152
footage here. Actually I can do that

754
00:48:01,152 --> 00:48:03,632
here. Ohh

755
00:48:06,512 --> 00:48:09,152
I'll pull up this footage.

756
00:48:14,512 --> 00:48:16,432
I love watching it myself, which is the

757
00:48:16,432 --> 00:48:18,112
reason why I pulled it up in the first

758
00:48:18,112 --> 00:48:18,432
place.

759
00:49:00,752 --> 00:49:02,512
This is today, earlier today.

760
00:49:19,252 --> 00:49:21,792
Most beautiful beach in the world. most

761
00:49:21,792 --> 00:49:22,912
awesome beach in the world.

762
00:49:24,913 --> 00:49:26,873
That was Ron John Surf Stop we just went

763
00:49:26,873 --> 00:49:29,793
by. I used to work right there

764
00:49:29,793 --> 00:49:31,393
at the Holiday Inn Surfside for about a

765
00:49:31,393 --> 00:49:33,313
year as a room service waiter when I was

766
00:49:33,313 --> 00:49:35,913
younger, 35 years ago, 34 years ago.

767
00:49:38,513 --> 00:49:40,673
With Paul Melnick, who still works there,

768
00:49:40,673 --> 00:49:43,553
by the way, I'm pretty sure. I

769
00:49:43,713 --> 00:49:45,153
talked to him about a year ago when I

770
00:49:45,153 --> 00:49:46,713
called him up. He's like, Oh, I'm still

771
00:49:46,713 --> 00:49:49,073
here. I should ask him if I can work

772
00:49:49,233 --> 00:49:50,673
there, actually I should.

773
00:49:52,273 --> 00:49:54,353
Duh I need to do that.

774
00:49:57,553 --> 00:49:59,553
I love being a room service waiter. It

775
00:49:59,553 --> 00:50:01,633
was like one of my favorite jobs ever. I

776
00:50:01,633 --> 00:50:03,393
gotta go back. I wonder if it'll take me

777
00:50:03,393 --> 00:50:03,633
back.

778
00:50:10,953 --> 00:50:12,833
And I could get in a lot better shapetoo.

779
00:50:31,153 --> 00:50:33,553
She was pretty. Anyway, no hard feelings,

780
00:50:34,353 --> 00:50:36,793
but she's she's pretty. Anyway,

781
00:50:37,153 --> 00:50:37,473
how'd you

782
00:50:42,833 --> 00:50:45,153
go about it?She reminds me of a girl

783
00:50:45,153 --> 00:50:46,953
named April Dalton who broke my heart.

784
00:50:46,953 --> 00:50:48,993
Really, just like dashed it into little

785
00:50:49,393 --> 00:50:49,793
pieces.

786
00:50:52,393 --> 00:50:54,233
used to work with at Netflix on East Bay

787
00:50:54,793 --> 00:50:57,554
and East Bay. It's definitely hard to doit

788
00:51:00,914 --> 00:51:02,754
with Netflix customer service for like

789
00:51:02,754 --> 00:51:04,634
three years. That was the funnest job.

790
00:51:04,634 --> 00:51:04,754
These

791
00:51:15,474 --> 00:51:17,154
bricks are ancient, like ancient,

792
00:51:17,154 --> 00:51:20,074
ancient. You go take a picture

793
00:51:20,074 --> 00:51:20,434
of those

794
00:51:24,914 --> 00:51:27,234
you know They were ballast

795
00:51:27,234 --> 00:51:29,074
supposedly on ships. I don't believe

796
00:51:29,074 --> 00:51:31,474
anything out of it. Huh

797
00:51:33,314 --> 00:51:35,794
Well, they were ballast brought over on

798
00:51:35,794 --> 00:51:37,074
ships, but that's a lie.

799
00:51:39,394 --> 00:51:40,034
Hi, rating.

800
00:51:42,434 --> 00:51:42,754
Ooh

801
00:52:01,904 --> 00:52:03,824
The Rockaway Grill.

802
00:52:05,504 --> 00:52:07,344
Frenchy's Rockaway Grill.

803
00:52:13,184 --> 00:52:13,984
The original.

804
00:52:19,554 --> 00:52:21,394
It's such a beautiful day outside. You're

805
00:52:21,594 --> 00:52:24,234
like, Ken, why are you in here doing that?

806
00:52:24,514 --> 00:52:25,874
Because I'm really comfortable and I'm

807
00:52:25,874 --> 00:52:28,235
enjoying reliving it with you right now.

808
00:52:33,395 --> 00:52:35,395
I see all these reaction videos, but this

809
00:52:35,395 --> 00:52:38,115
was my day and this is, you know, what I

810
00:52:38,115 --> 00:52:41,075
did. I took a med and five dogs

811
00:52:41,075 --> 00:52:43,355
out to the dog park, two places in the

812
00:52:43,355 --> 00:52:45,035
most beautiful place I can think of.

813
00:52:46,475 --> 00:52:49,315
And now I'm sharing it with you. And I

814
00:52:49,315 --> 00:52:51,235
have a higher resolution version up if

815
00:52:51,235 --> 00:52:52,715
you want to watch it. And if you don't,

816
00:52:52,715 --> 00:52:55,395
that's cool. But I love watching them

817
00:52:55,395 --> 00:52:56,995
just sometimes. And I'm going to go back

818
00:52:57,035 --> 00:52:58,875
a year later, and I've got some that are

819
00:52:58,875 --> 00:53:01,555
a year old. And it's just neat seeing how

820
00:53:01,555 --> 00:53:03,835
the place changes. But more importantly,

821
00:53:03,835 --> 00:53:06,515
what's really great is how immersive

822
00:53:06,515 --> 00:53:08,195
these are. If you're lucky enough to

823
00:53:08,195 --> 00:53:09,715
watch it on a big screen,

824
00:53:11,475 --> 00:53:13,795
it's just like being there for me when I

825
00:53:13,875 --> 00:53:16,275
watch this. I'm watching it on a good

826
00:53:16,275 --> 00:53:19,235
monitor, andI've got

827
00:53:19,235 --> 00:53:22,195
120 hertz and it just feels like

828
00:53:22,195 --> 00:53:22,915
I'm there.

829
00:53:26,355 --> 00:53:28,595
And so for my buddy in Japan, he's like,

830
00:53:28,595 --> 00:53:30,915
it's all dense and congested. He can come

831
00:53:30,915 --> 00:53:33,235
here and sit down with me and my Cadillac

832
00:53:33,235 --> 00:53:35,795
and ride along the coolest

833
00:53:35,795 --> 00:53:38,595
beachfront in the world. This is

834
00:53:38,595 --> 00:53:40,355
one of the coolest beachfronts in the

835
00:53:40,395 --> 00:53:42,915
world, plain and simple. It's Clearwater

836
00:53:42,915 --> 00:53:43,875
Beach, Florida.

837
00:53:46,195 --> 00:53:48,835
And I used to work there at the Holiday

838
00:53:48,835 --> 00:53:51,155
Inn Surfside when it was a Holiday Inn

839
00:53:51,955 --> 00:53:54,115
and not a Hilton or whatever it is

840
00:54:03,036 --> 00:54:05,076
now. Ah Erica just called, call her back

841
00:54:05,076 --> 00:54:07,956
on your phone please. Erica, call

842
00:54:07,956 --> 00:54:09,356
her back on your phone please. Call her

843
00:54:09,356 --> 00:54:11,276
on your phone please. Okay, just call her

844
00:54:11,676 --> 00:54:11,916
back.

845
00:54:17,756 --> 00:54:20,156
Man, we have an interesting life. We have

846
00:54:20,156 --> 00:54:22,116
an interesting life. How many people have

847
00:54:22,116 --> 00:54:24,996
five dogs and four guys

848
00:54:25,036 --> 00:54:27,476
and the hottest girl in the universe that

849
00:54:27,476 --> 00:54:30,356
they live with?I know I live

850
00:54:30,356 --> 00:54:32,836
with the hottest girl in the universe. My

851
00:54:32,916 --> 00:54:35,636
fifth element. HuhHuh

852
00:54:36,756 --> 00:54:39,036
Pier 60 at the beach, right. It's the end

853
00:54:39,036 --> 00:54:41,836
of the Route 60. And

854
00:54:41,836 --> 00:54:44,676
Route 60 goes all the way across thestreet

855
00:54:55,956 --> 00:54:56,676
But yeah,

856
00:55:01,976 --> 00:55:03,976
that's pretty cool. I'm

857
00:55:06,616 --> 00:55:07,776
coming back around here.

858
00:55:16,376 --> 00:55:18,056
I love my hometown.

859
00:55:20,056 --> 00:55:21,896
I love this place so much.

860
00:55:25,316 --> 00:55:27,476
Every little thing about it is just so

861
00:55:27,476 --> 00:55:29,997
awesome. And yeah, I don't get to ride

862
00:55:29,997 --> 00:55:32,437
down on the beachfront as much as I do on

863
00:55:32,437 --> 00:55:35,197
the bicycle, but I do get to

864
00:55:35,197 --> 00:55:37,317
ride down there in the Cadillac. And

865
00:55:38,277 --> 00:55:40,397
it's very, very nice.

866
00:55:41,877 --> 00:55:42,837
Very nice. Oh,

867
00:55:51,557 --> 00:55:53,317
yeah. You have the pass to the island?Huh

868
00:55:54,117 --> 00:55:55,757
I have it in the truck. We can go back

869
00:55:55,757 --> 00:55:57,917
and get the truck. I mean, it took

870
00:55:58,197 --> 00:55:59,877
Thursdays a long time to wait for

871
00:56:01,677 --> 00:56:01,917
it. Yeah.

872
00:56:14,357 --> 00:56:15,797
All right, some fat chicks.

873
00:56:17,317 --> 00:56:19,317
Damn, they're nice. There's the fat

874
00:56:19,317 --> 00:56:21,077
chicks. I'm just kidding. They're

875
00:56:21,077 --> 00:56:23,917
beautiful. They're just curvilineous.

876
00:56:24,997 --> 00:56:25,717
Curvilicious.

877
00:56:27,717 --> 00:56:30,437
We We appreciate them, and there's a

878
00:56:30,437 --> 00:56:32,437
place for every kind of body type. We

879
00:56:32,437 --> 00:56:33,237
just prefer

880
00:56:36,117 --> 00:56:37,117
our fifth elements.

881
00:56:41,237 --> 00:56:42,677
Hi, guys. Hello.

882
00:56:44,837 --> 00:56:47,477
I'm taken. She kind of gets frustrated

883
00:56:47,477 --> 00:56:49,477
when I do this. She thinks I'm perving.

884
00:56:49,477 --> 00:56:51,157
I'm not perving. I'm just being a normal

885
00:56:51,157 --> 00:56:51,317
guy.

886
00:56:54,197 --> 00:56:56,397
I am, but sometimes guys in other

887
00:56:56,397 --> 00:56:58,037
countries, they might like to come down

888
00:56:58,037 --> 00:57:00,757
here and see what it's like here. Welcome

889
00:57:00,797 --> 00:57:02,598
to Clearwater, Florida.

890
00:57:07,718 --> 00:57:09,838
I love this place. I love this place.

891
00:57:13,238 --> 00:57:15,318
My favorite place in the universe.

892
00:57:17,638 --> 00:57:19,238
Thank goodness, again.

893
00:57:21,718 --> 00:57:24,438
To spend so much time here. But this is

894
00:57:24,438 --> 00:57:26,358
the reason why you came to America, man.

895
00:57:26,518 --> 00:57:28,678
I don't know if you know that, but I

896
00:57:28,918 --> 00:57:31,398
think now you know that this

897
00:57:33,078 --> 00:57:35,758
ritual of going to the dog park

898
00:57:35,838 --> 00:57:38,198
andsinging our Hakuna

899
00:57:38,238 --> 00:57:40,598
Matadas and talking to the locals and

900
00:57:42,358 --> 00:57:44,198
celebrating all that is great and

901
00:57:44,198 --> 00:57:46,678
wonderful in life together, and then

902
00:57:46,678 --> 00:57:49,398
driving around and touring the most

903
00:57:49,398 --> 00:57:52,198
beautiful beach. That people come

904
00:57:52,198 --> 00:57:54,598
here from everywhere around the world,

905
00:57:54,598 --> 00:57:56,918
even from Alexandria, Egypt of all

906
00:57:56,918 --> 00:57:59,758
places, and hang out.

907
00:58:05,078 --> 00:58:06,758
I haven't met any Russians here,

908
00:58:07,078 --> 00:58:10,038
actually. I've met some people from

909
00:58:10,038 --> 00:58:12,078
Green Bay, Wisconsin. They're cheese, I'm

910
00:58:12,078 --> 00:58:14,998
not kidding. I did meet some people from

911
00:58:15,278 --> 00:58:17,238
from Wisconsin here once, and everywhere

912
00:58:17,238 --> 00:58:17,478
else.

913
00:58:24,818 --> 00:58:27,058
This is a single take, we're at like 10

914
00:58:27,098 --> 00:58:28,618
or 11 minutes. Thank you.

915
00:58:37,239 --> 00:58:38,239
Oh, look at the car.

916
00:58:39,959 --> 00:58:42,679
It's so sexy. It really is a

917
00:58:42,679 --> 00:58:44,799
sexy car. And it's really comfortable.

918
00:58:45,359 --> 00:58:46,959
like Really comfortable, right?We're

919
00:58:46,999 --> 00:58:49,719
sitting in like 60 degree ice

920
00:58:49,719 --> 00:58:52,479
cold air right now. It

921
00:58:53,639 --> 00:58:55,159
could definitely use the Sole Van, but

922
00:58:55,159 --> 00:58:56,999
the Sole Van's AC doesn't work this way.

923
00:58:57,199 --> 00:58:59,799
I'm sorry. The Sole Van has two air

924
00:58:59,799 --> 00:59:02,759
conditioners, but it doesn't cool as

925
00:59:02,759 --> 00:59:03,559
well as this one does.

926
00:59:06,199 --> 00:59:08,359
And this is Circle K up here,

927
00:59:10,279 --> 00:59:11,879
where I made sure that strange things

928
00:59:11,879 --> 00:59:12,359
were afoot.

929
00:59:16,999 --> 00:59:18,599
And then up on our right here, we have

930
00:59:18,599 --> 00:59:21,359
Shepherds. And

931
00:59:21,359 --> 00:59:23,599
Shepherds is a long time institution of

932
00:59:23,599 --> 00:59:26,039
Clearwater. I need you to keep your

933
00:59:26,279 --> 00:59:29,079
head there. I

934
00:59:29,239 --> 00:59:31,159
I went to this speedway right here, which

935
00:59:31,159 --> 00:59:33,559
was actually a Circle K when I was a kid

936
00:59:33,719 --> 00:59:36,519
34 years ago. And I met these

937
00:59:36,519 --> 00:59:38,679
two girls, Angela and Kit here with my

938
00:59:38,679 --> 00:59:41,639
buddy Lou from the Navy where I was

939
00:59:42,239 --> 00:59:44,439
stationed in Orlando. Here's Shepherds

940
00:59:45,319 --> 00:59:47,119
Beach Resort. I used to come up here on

941
00:59:47,119 --> 00:59:47,559
my boat.

942
00:59:54,759 --> 00:59:56,679
All these places are new and beautiful.

943
00:59:56,679 --> 00:59:58,199
They're cool. JW Marriott.

944
01:00:01,639 --> 01:00:02,839
We're going to U-turn on the other side

945
01:00:02,839 --> 01:00:03,560
of here by the way.

946
01:00:06,200 --> 01:00:07,640
I just wanted to get this off camera. You

947
01:00:07,640 --> 01:00:10,440
don't mind dude?You're not in a hurry are

948
01:00:10,600 --> 01:00:10,680
you?

949
01:00:17,720 --> 01:00:19,320
This is the highlight of my day.

950
01:00:23,240 --> 01:00:25,080
But the main part about this is that I

951
01:00:25,080 --> 01:00:26,840
get to share this with everybody.

952
01:00:28,680 --> 01:00:31,120
Would you please call her though?Would

953
01:00:31,120 --> 01:00:31,960
you call her real quick?

954
01:00:34,280 --> 01:00:35,960
Please be nice to her.

955
01:00:37,160 --> 01:00:39,240
She's a human being dude.

956
01:00:41,240 --> 01:00:42,320
Yes she is. And

957
01:00:44,280 --> 01:00:47,080
she loves you. yes she

958
01:00:47,080 --> 01:00:47,560
does

959
01:00:52,360 --> 01:00:55,080
more than I do probably in different

960
01:00:55,080 --> 01:00:57,400
ways because I'm a kid dude

961
01:00:57,880 --> 01:00:58,920
I'm just saying

962
01:01:02,680 --> 01:01:04,200
oh it's so beautiful

963
01:01:07,280 --> 01:01:08,040
okay okay

964
01:01:14,090 --> 01:01:15,970
I haven't gotten one of these in a while

965
01:01:15,970 --> 01:01:18,880
and since myMy hand mount broke. I've

966
01:01:18,880 --> 01:01:20,280
kind of stopped shooting a lot of

967
01:01:20,280 --> 01:01:23,040
handheld video because I miss my gimbal

968
01:01:23,040 --> 01:01:25,160
mount so much and I can't afford to get

969
01:01:25,160 --> 01:01:28,080
another one right now. Because it

970
01:01:28,080 --> 01:01:29,480
takes such awesome video...

971
01:01:30,920 --> 01:01:33,080
Island that we need to go out and hang

972
01:01:33,080 --> 01:01:35,681
out on. Oh ohh yeah, it's a little island

973
01:01:35,681 --> 01:01:36,521
in the middle of the thing.

974
01:01:56,041 --> 01:01:58,041
Ah, actually we'll turn up here.

975
01:02:01,241 --> 01:02:01,921
Up here. We'll

976
01:02:03,921 --> 01:02:06,841
go to the beach?Might as well.

977
01:02:08,441 --> 01:02:11,281
Loop up here. HuhOh, at least

978
01:02:11,281 --> 01:02:13,001
turn around up here. You want to go out

979
01:02:13,001 --> 01:02:14,761
there real quick. You just can't really

980
01:02:14,761 --> 01:02:17,401
go with the dogs. But there's no park

981
01:02:17,401 --> 01:02:19,761
here. There's a nice little small park

982
01:02:19,761 --> 01:02:22,001
here. There's a dog park in here?Yeah.

983
01:02:22,001 --> 01:02:24,201
Let's go there real quick. Okay, we're

984
01:02:24,201 --> 01:02:27,041
going there. Where is it?Take me there.

985
01:02:27,041 --> 01:02:27,081
Oh,

986
01:02:30,601 --> 01:02:32,241
I see, it might be over there.

987
01:02:34,321 --> 01:02:34,961
Let's go to it. Is

988
01:02:39,721 --> 01:02:41,161
that weed on you?HuhIs that weed?

989
01:02:42,441 --> 01:02:42,721
No.

990
01:02:59,201 --> 01:03:01,841
The doggies just heard themselves

991
01:03:02,001 --> 01:03:04,481
and started barking. I had to remind them

992
01:03:04,481 --> 01:03:06,682
that I was watching us earlier today.

993
01:03:06,682 --> 01:03:08,242
These guys are scooting along, we're

994
01:03:08,482 --> 01:03:11,002
going 21. That's,

995
01:03:11,842 --> 01:03:14,162
they're actually even pushing hard, but

996
01:03:14,162 --> 01:03:16,802
they're going like, they're they're

997
01:03:16,802 --> 01:03:19,322
zooming. These bikes,

998
01:03:21,122 --> 01:03:22,402
I mean, they're zooming along, we're

999
01:03:22,402 --> 01:03:23,962
going 17 right now.

1000
01:03:39,952 --> 01:03:41,552
And now we're going 19.

1001
01:03:47,552 --> 01:03:49,632
I love this. This is so much fun. It's so

1002
01:03:49,632 --> 01:03:51,712
much fun holding the camera and driving

1003
01:03:51,752 --> 01:03:54,032
and inginginginging. Because I'm a battle

1004
01:03:54,032 --> 01:03:56,952
mech, actually. Hey, can

1005
01:03:56,952 --> 01:03:59,802
you come over here?Would

1006
01:03:59,802 --> 01:04:01,722
you guys... I guess you guys need to

1007
01:04:01,722 --> 01:04:04,442
play. Keep on playing. We're doing

1008
01:04:04,442 --> 01:04:05,162
20 now.

1009
01:04:07,402 --> 01:04:09,882
Living room lights on.

1010
01:04:10,762 --> 01:04:13,722
You can play. I just need to break you

1011
01:04:13,722 --> 01:04:16,202
up. Where's the dog area?Huh

1012
01:04:16,602 --> 01:04:18,682
I love these dogs so much.

1013
01:04:19,482 --> 01:04:20,882
I love my Meeka too.

1014
01:04:27,082 --> 01:04:29,162
And Max. I love Max.

1015
01:04:30,362 --> 01:04:33,242
Yeah, it has those shots. I saw the

1016
01:04:33,322 --> 01:04:35,002
Vincent area. I mean, it's right there,

1017
01:04:35,562 --> 01:04:35,682
yeah.

1018
01:04:40,003 --> 01:04:41,003
Excuse me.

1019
01:04:43,723 --> 01:04:45,803
I have like ozymphic breath, so I have

1020
01:04:45,803 --> 01:04:47,963
like zero stomach acid. And then this

1021
01:04:47,963 --> 01:04:50,683
morning I woke up and I had to vomit

1022
01:04:50,883 --> 01:04:53,483
like undigested spinach that I ate last

1023
01:04:53,523 --> 01:04:56,243
night. But it really didn't

1024
01:04:56,243 --> 01:04:58,443
taste that bad. It was just spinach and

1025
01:04:58,443 --> 01:05:01,243
it wasn't digested. So I can't eat... I'm

1026
01:05:01,243 --> 01:05:03,883
not... But I can live off of

1027
01:05:03,883 --> 01:05:04,763
orange juice.

1028
01:05:07,083 --> 01:05:08,843
Which is totally cool.

1029
01:05:11,723 --> 01:05:14,563
Almost... Equally cool is this

1030
01:05:14,763 --> 01:05:17,723
awesome dog park we found. It was

1031
01:05:17,723 --> 01:05:18,523
so great.

1032
01:05:21,283 --> 01:05:22,683
And the dogs hear themselves.

1033
01:05:45,463 --> 01:05:45,863
ohh

1034
01:05:48,583 --> 01:05:50,023
I love it. I

1035
01:05:51,543 --> 01:05:51,983
love it. Alright,

1036
01:05:54,423 --> 01:05:55,103
let's see what we got.

1037
01:05:57,623 --> 01:05:58,343
Oh crap.

1038
01:06:02,923 --> 01:06:05,283
We already saw those. Come see this one.

1039
01:06:19,244 --> 01:06:21,084
Sorry, you don't have to stay and watch

1040
01:06:21,084 --> 01:06:23,804
it. I just love watching it. And I

1041
01:06:23,804 --> 01:06:26,004
figure I might as well record it here and

1042
01:06:26,004 --> 01:06:28,764
upload it so then... If I

1043
01:06:28,764 --> 01:06:30,524
ever get stuck in one of those

1044
01:06:30,764 --> 01:06:33,244
frustrating situations again, at least

1045
01:06:33,244 --> 01:06:35,084
I'll know that this will be out there if

1046
01:06:35,084 --> 01:06:36,684
I ever get unstuck. I'm going

1047
01:06:38,124 --> 01:06:40,684
to take my arm back here. It sucks when

1048
01:06:40,684 --> 01:06:43,164
you get stuck. There you go. And you

1049
01:06:43,164 --> 01:06:46,084
don't have anything or anyone at all.

1050
01:06:47,004 --> 01:06:49,004
It really sucks. That's really the main

1051
01:06:49,004 --> 01:06:51,084
reason for the angel, alas,

1052
01:06:52,044 --> 01:06:54,844
is to help Ernesto, my

1053
01:06:54,884 --> 01:06:55,644
best buddy.

1054
01:07:00,164 --> 01:07:00,404
Go

1055
01:07:04,924 --> 01:07:06,964
ahead. Go ahead.

1056
01:07:08,204 --> 01:07:09,804
They're like looking at me like I was

1057
01:07:09,804 --> 01:07:11,964
crazy. Of course I'm going to record you

1058
01:07:11,964 --> 01:07:14,764
walking across the way. And

1059
01:07:14,764 --> 01:07:17,084
hopefully this gets you so you can come

1060
01:07:17,084 --> 01:07:19,324
back and watch it one day. That's the

1061
01:07:19,324 --> 01:07:22,164
whole point. of it is to

1062
01:07:22,204 --> 01:07:24,044
get as many people as I can. I'm

1063
01:07:24,044 --> 01:07:26,924
hoovering this up. I can't

1064
01:07:27,244 --> 01:07:29,724
drive down here and not record it. It's

1065
01:07:29,724 --> 01:07:32,044
so beautiful. And then I'm like, I just

1066
01:07:32,044 --> 01:07:34,524
have to share it. And even though

1067
01:07:34,524 --> 01:07:36,684
nobody watches this yet,

1068
01:07:37,884 --> 01:07:40,685
I can't imagine that at

1069
01:07:40,685 --> 01:07:43,325
some point this won't be

1070
01:07:44,125 --> 01:07:46,965
likeThe very best, sorry, I just changed

1071
01:07:46,965 --> 01:07:48,485
that. And I'm just saying, I don't know

1072
01:07:48,485 --> 01:07:50,325
if you even heard a word I just said,

1073
01:07:50,325 --> 01:07:52,045
'cause I'm not monitoring my output

1074
01:07:52,045 --> 01:07:54,445
levels. Don't know how to do that yet.

1075
01:08:03,275 --> 01:08:05,595
Okay, so I just like muted my

1076
01:08:05,595 --> 01:08:08,235
desktop audio, but then I have my volume

1077
01:08:08,235 --> 01:08:10,315
set up so that you can hear what I'm

1078
01:08:10,315 --> 01:08:11,515
listening to through that.

1079
01:08:13,595 --> 01:08:14,635
Ah Anyhow.

1080
01:08:20,245 --> 01:08:22,045
It's just such a beautiful day. This is

1081
01:08:22,045 --> 01:08:23,005
literally today.

1082
01:08:24,845 --> 01:08:27,725
41 p.m., so it's

1083
01:08:27,765 --> 01:08:30,525
still beautiful outside. But I

1084
01:08:30,525 --> 01:08:32,445
was really making this in response to

1085
01:08:32,445 --> 01:08:35,285
Donato, but more importantly, it's like

1086
01:08:35,285 --> 01:08:37,965
this is, I live every day like I'm on

1087
01:08:38,005 --> 01:08:40,925
vacation, you know, and and

1088
01:08:41,725 --> 01:08:44,605
I'm lucky to have all of these

1089
01:08:44,605 --> 01:08:46,285
roommates and dogs around me.

1090
01:08:49,285 --> 01:08:52,125
And I was like, at the park, and that guy

1091
01:08:52,125 --> 01:08:55,085
was like, with the Tesla,

1092
01:08:55,085 --> 01:08:57,485
I was like, Do you have any roommates?No,

1093
01:08:57,805 --> 01:09:00,285
but I have a dog. And I was like, he

1094
01:09:00,285 --> 01:09:02,845
lives in a big house on the beach

1095
01:09:03,245 --> 01:09:05,885
and he doesn't have any roommates. He's

1096
01:09:05,885 --> 01:09:08,285
married. But

1097
01:09:09,245 --> 01:09:11,166
you know, it's like when when you're

1098
01:09:11,166 --> 01:09:13,806
packed in an area like I am,

1099
01:09:14,806 --> 01:09:17,166
It's so much more fun and interesting

1100
01:09:17,166 --> 01:09:19,526
than whenever I lived in my little

1101
01:09:21,406 --> 01:09:23,726
house. It wasn't a McMansion, it was a

1102
01:09:23,726 --> 01:09:26,686
McHouse, but it's about $340,000 now.

1103
01:09:26,686 --> 01:09:29,566
But anyhow, that house,

1104
01:09:29,646 --> 01:09:32,086
I was so isolated in it. I had one

1105
01:09:32,086 --> 01:09:34,846
neighbor friend, and I had a chick down

1106
01:09:34,846 --> 01:09:36,606
the street. But here, man, it's like

1107
01:09:36,606 --> 01:09:38,926
we're all packed in, but it's beautiful

1108
01:09:38,926 --> 01:09:40,526
because we're forced by certain

1109
01:09:40,526 --> 01:09:43,326
circumstances to be here. And it's

1110
01:09:43,326 --> 01:09:45,566
just this wonderful little enclave.

1111
01:09:47,966 --> 01:09:49,086
And paradise.

1112
01:09:58,136 --> 01:09:59,976
And this is just coming off the beach

1113
01:09:59,976 --> 01:10:00,416
here.

1114
01:10:04,096 --> 01:10:06,576
Oh, and that's Pier 60 right there.

1115
01:10:10,656 --> 01:10:11,696
Let's bruise this up.

1116
01:10:23,006 --> 01:10:23,086
the

1117
01:10:31,686 --> 01:10:33,806
electronic music trending worldwide,

1118
01:10:34,806 --> 01:10:36,446
to the top emerging dance songs of the

1119
01:10:36,446 --> 01:10:37,726
week. Big Chainsmokers Electronics.

1120
01:10:38,166 --> 01:10:38,846
SiriusXM.

1121
01:10:43,967 --> 01:10:45,287
What's going on everybody?It's

1122
01:10:45,287 --> 01:10:47,687
Chainsmokers fan with an airport edition

1123
01:10:48,247 --> 01:10:50,967
of Electronical Team. SiriusXM BPS has

1124
01:10:50,967 --> 01:10:52,287
got an awesome show for you guys this

1125
01:10:52,287 --> 01:10:53,367
week, but I'm going to have to keep it a

1126
01:10:53,367 --> 01:10:54,647
little bit brief because I

1127
01:10:58,527 --> 01:11:00,847
Oh, ohh we love the Chainsmokers. We love

1128
01:11:00,847 --> 01:11:02,887
SiriusXM. I hope they don't give us a

1129
01:11:02,887 --> 01:11:05,007
strike. If they do, no hard feelings.

1130
01:11:07,807 --> 01:11:09,567
We're not monetized or anything yet.

1131
01:11:10,287 --> 01:11:12,927
Hopefully, maybe soon. I don't know, but.

1132
01:11:17,327 --> 01:11:20,287
Maybe somebody will watch us. I think we

1133
01:11:20,287 --> 01:11:23,167
have interesting content. It's not

1134
01:11:23,167 --> 01:11:25,247
for everybody, but it's authentic and

1135
01:11:25,247 --> 01:11:28,047
it's not AI generated. We actually go

1136
01:11:28,047 --> 01:11:30,447
out and do these things. I don't know how

1137
01:11:30,447 --> 01:11:32,127
many people you know that will lip sync

1138
01:11:32,127 --> 01:11:34,047
on, you know, camera. Anyway.

1139
01:11:38,127 --> 01:11:39,567
On their dash cam in the middle.

1140
01:11:42,367 --> 01:11:44,287
How many people that will do that

1141
01:11:45,327 --> 01:11:47,487
and pull it up?I did pull it up.

1142
01:11:58,767 --> 01:12:00,367
Oh, it's so beautiful.

1143
01:12:07,667 --> 01:12:10,467
I love this big dog. And you're not even

1144
01:12:10,467 --> 01:12:12,627
the big one. Every time I see you, I

1145
01:12:12,627 --> 01:12:14,188
think you're the big one and then the big

1146
01:12:14,188 --> 01:12:16,548
one comes along and I go, That's the big

1147
01:12:16,548 --> 01:12:17,748
one. That's Diesel. Ah

1148
01:13:18,318 --> 01:13:20,318
Alright, if you've watched this far,

1149
01:13:20,318 --> 01:13:21,918
thank you so much.

1150
01:13:23,038 --> 01:13:24,998
We usually end right up here at the

1151
01:13:24,998 --> 01:13:27,918
Indigo. That's the big blue building up

1152
01:13:27,918 --> 01:13:30,718
on the right. So we'll

1153
01:13:30,718 --> 01:13:33,398
be ending at the Indigo today and I

1154
01:13:33,398 --> 01:13:34,558
actually did a little

1155
01:13:36,638 --> 01:13:39,558
gig work thing to go review that place

1156
01:13:39,558 --> 01:13:41,278
and I actually got paid for it where my

1157
01:13:41,518 --> 01:13:43,278
Fifth Element did anyhow.

1158
01:13:45,609 --> 01:13:48,209
And so here we are at

1159
01:13:49,369 --> 01:13:49,569
um

1160
01:13:52,209 --> 01:13:54,049
South Myrtle where I used to go inline

1161
01:13:54,049 --> 01:13:56,369
skating every week, three or four days a

1162
01:13:56,369 --> 01:13:59,009
week actually. Thank

1163
01:14:05,889 --> 01:14:08,689
you and have a blessed day. See you

1164
01:14:08,689 --> 01:14:10,369
soon. Thanks for watching.
