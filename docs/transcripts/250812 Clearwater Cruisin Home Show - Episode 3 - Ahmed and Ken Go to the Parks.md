Clearwater Cruisin’ Home Show — Episode 3: Ahmed & Ken Go to the Parks

A herald’s epic in compact form: a park pilgrimage and SoulVan sermons. With Ahmed (Naked Soul Brother from Alexandria) and our five furry guardians, we loop paradise — VA fountains, Strange Clouds alchemy, Enterprise Dog Park rites — living every day like it’s a vacation and ministry in motion.

A laid‑back day log with Ahmed: Enterprise Dog Park rituals, a love‑letter tour of VA Bay Pines, a quick stop at Strange Clouds to greet friends, and a golden‑hour coastline cruise in the Cadillac. Five dogs, new neighbors, micro‑missions — the simple rhythms that make Clearwater home.

- 🚐 SoulFleet dispatches – real‑world missions, livestreams, and roadside sermons
- ⚡ Angel OS development – building a soul‑aligned operating system for humanity
- 🎥 Field reports – political protest, spiritual warfare, and divine resilience
- 💡 Neo‑spiritual tools – bridging technology, mysticism, and street‑level outreach

Always be excellent to each other — and party on, tastefully.

Copy tip
- Trim to 12–16 chapter stamps for YouTube if you want a tighter description; keep VA tour, Strange Clouds, and sunset cruise as anchors.
