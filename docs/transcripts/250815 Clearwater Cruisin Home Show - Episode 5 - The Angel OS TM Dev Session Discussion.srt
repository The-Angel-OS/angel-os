1
00:00:01,760 --> 00:00:04,400
Good evening, everyone who happens to be

2
00:00:04,400 --> 00:00:06,480
watching right now, which is probably

3
00:00:06,480 --> 00:00:08,720
nobody because nobody watches this. Come

4
00:00:08,720 --> 00:00:10,800
on now. I'm boring as all get out, baby.

5
00:00:11,120 --> 00:00:12,720
Who knows?It is

6
00:00:12,720 --> 00:00:15,160
633 on the

7
00:00:15,280 --> 00:00:17,200
15th Friday.

8
00:00:19,480 --> 00:00:22,360
I'm broke. That's a story for another

9
00:00:22,360 --> 00:00:25,320
day. But I have good news. I decided to

10
00:00:25,360 --> 00:00:27,680
pick up on development of. The

11
00:00:27,680 --> 00:00:30,560
Angel OS and

12
00:00:31,120 --> 00:00:32,920
I made a little progress and you might

13
00:00:32,920 --> 00:00:34,720
think it's a little hokey, but here,

14
00:00:34,720 --> 00:00:36,560
let's take a look at what we've got so

15
00:00:36,560 --> 00:00:37,040
far.

16
00:00:51,041 --> 00:00:54,001
My development instance right here and

17
00:00:54,001 --> 00:00:54,641
this is

18
00:00:57,121 --> 00:00:57,681
not it.

19
00:01:28,481 --> 00:01:30,561
OK, so I just enhanced the products

20
00:01:30,561 --> 00:01:33,441
collection inside of the payload

21
00:01:33,441 --> 00:01:36,321
CMS website and

22
00:01:36,321 --> 00:01:38,441
we've got some migrations that we have to

23
00:01:38,441 --> 00:01:41,321
do. So right now what I do

24
00:01:41,321 --> 00:01:43,841
is I go in here and I press the enter

25
00:01:43,841 --> 00:01:46,641
key. You can see all the

26
00:01:46,641 --> 00:01:49,601
column and tables have been resolved.

27
00:01:49,601 --> 00:01:52,401
So here's our payload CMS

28
00:01:52,401 --> 00:01:53,521
website now.

29
00:01:58,081 --> 00:02:00,161
We'll make this a little bigger

30
00:02:01,121 --> 00:02:02,401
so you can see it.

31
00:02:04,361 --> 00:02:06,081
And we'll throw this up here.

32
00:02:18,562 --> 00:02:20,322
I don't have those things anymore. Oh, I

33
00:02:20,322 --> 00:02:22,162
guess that's a Windows Power Toy feature.

34
00:02:23,682 --> 00:02:25,762
All right, so Windows Power Toys has this

35
00:02:25,762 --> 00:02:26,562
cool thing.

36
00:02:29,122 --> 00:02:32,002
Where where you can like. There it

37
00:02:32,002 --> 00:02:34,322
is. Well There.

38
00:02:34,722 --> 00:02:37,522
Alright. So now we

39
00:02:37,522 --> 00:02:38,082
have our

40
00:02:40,162 --> 00:02:42,482
cursor window open. We don't need our

41
00:02:42,482 --> 00:02:45,202
file list here. See all the

42
00:02:45,202 --> 00:02:46,802
files that we're working on. We'll make

43
00:02:46,802 --> 00:02:49,042
this a little bigger so you can see it.

44
00:02:49,042 --> 00:02:51,962
We'll close the file list out. Don't

45
00:02:51,962 --> 00:02:54,002
really need the code window so much, but

46
00:02:54,002 --> 00:02:55,602
you can't really get rid of it. Don't

47
00:02:55,602 --> 00:02:57,202
even really look at it so much these

48
00:02:57,202 --> 00:02:58,682
days. And you're like, Karen, why don't

49
00:02:58,682 --> 00:03:01,362
you look at the code window?Well, because

50
00:03:01,442 --> 00:03:04,242
it just got so smart. You don't need to

51
00:03:04,242 --> 00:03:07,202
anyway. But you do need to know, pay

52
00:03:07,202 --> 00:03:08,642
attention to what you're doing. And right

53
00:03:08,642 --> 00:03:09,762
now we've got our

54
00:03:11,762 --> 00:03:14,642
default Angel OS, which is still named

55
00:03:14,642 --> 00:03:16,962
Spaces because that's where it came from,

56
00:03:16,962 --> 00:03:18,082
is my spaces.

57
00:03:23,842 --> 00:03:26,322
And this is the cool little snappy

58
00:03:26,322 --> 00:03:29,282
control panel for it that I just whipped

59
00:03:29,282 --> 00:03:32,002
up. But I didn't really whip it up. So I

60
00:03:32,002 --> 00:03:33,842
have this other decent thing that I've

61
00:03:33,842 --> 00:03:35,922
been using for a while, which I used to

62
00:03:35,922 --> 00:03:38,723
mix and put put together all my

63
00:03:41,123 --> 00:03:42,643
dashcam videos.

64
00:03:44,403 --> 00:03:47,123
So anywho, and then here I'm going to try

65
00:03:47,123 --> 00:03:49,123
to say hello to Leo and see if he even

66
00:03:49,123 --> 00:03:51,603
works. Hi Leo R.

67
00:03:53,123 --> 00:03:54,803
Uh, where?Oh

68
00:03:56,243 --> 00:03:57,363
Ah, uh, uh, oh

69
00:04:00,563 --> 00:04:03,403
Leo just talked back to me. All right.

70
00:04:04,923 --> 00:04:07,723
Um, uh,

71
00:04:08,563 --> 00:04:10,643
intent detection, let's--

72
00:04:14,243 --> 00:04:15,363
oh, we were, um--

73
00:04:22,883 --> 00:04:24,243
shrink that down a little bit

74
00:04:29,203 --> 00:04:32,163
anyhow um

75
00:04:47,663 --> 00:04:50,463
so now we see Leo talking back to me but

76
00:04:50,463 --> 00:04:53,023
it's not really smart so we got to fix

77
00:04:53,023 --> 00:04:55,843
thatSo I'm going to go

78
00:04:55,843 --> 00:04:58,563
ahead and talk to Cloud 4.1 Opus

79
00:04:58,563 --> 00:05:00,483
Max right now. And I just did a

80
00:05:00,483 --> 00:05:02,643
screenshot, and I'm going to fire that

81
00:05:02,643 --> 00:05:04,323
off to the big guy himself.

82
00:05:18,644 --> 00:05:19,844
This is pretty, though.

83
00:05:30,244 --> 00:05:32,164
Oh. It's so

84
00:05:32,164 --> 00:05:33,764
pretty.

85
00:05:43,004 --> 00:05:43,484
Oh.

86
00:07:35,245 --> 00:07:35,365
OK,

87
00:07:52,245 --> 00:07:54,285
let me read around what I just posted. I

88
00:07:54,285 --> 00:07:56,405
just said note. Also, ideally we'd have a

89
00:07:56,405 --> 00:07:58,406
system console on the bottom which gives

90
00:07:58,406 --> 00:07:59,926
us any heartbeats or other service

91
00:07:59,926 --> 00:08:02,726
statuses for troubleshooting. Ideally,

92
00:08:02,726 --> 00:08:04,966
we'd also be able to conveniently copy

93
00:08:04,966 --> 00:08:07,006
formatted errors for submittal back to

94
00:08:07,006 --> 00:08:09,246
you for analysis and resolution :).

95
00:08:10,566 --> 00:08:12,806
Note that the responses weren't that

96
00:08:12,806 --> 00:08:15,526
smart yet, just analyzing. We need to be

97
00:08:15,526 --> 00:08:17,286
pumping messages through our business

98
00:08:17,286 --> 00:08:18,726
pumps, so to speak. We need to be

99
00:08:18,726 --> 00:08:20,406
dogfooding from round one.

100
00:08:21,526 --> 00:08:24,006
OK, and we're paying maximum for this

101
00:08:24,246 --> 00:08:26,566
Opus 4.1

102
00:08:26,566 --> 00:08:29,126
Max, but it's

103
00:08:29,126 --> 00:08:31,926
totally like it literally just. That

104
00:08:31,926 --> 00:08:34,566
just puts magical code into

105
00:08:34,566 --> 00:08:37,366
existence and it is it is and you're like

106
00:08:37,366 --> 00:08:39,126
and so right now what we have is an

107
00:08:39,126 --> 00:08:41,886
unprovisioned multi tenant payload

108
00:08:41,886 --> 00:08:44,566
CMS website 2.03.0

109
00:08:45,366 --> 00:08:48,246
template website template which

110
00:08:48,246 --> 00:08:50,966
has this awesome forms collection and all

111
00:08:50,966 --> 00:08:53,646
sorts of awesome capabilities. And then

112
00:08:53,646 --> 00:08:55,726
what we did was we took the seed script

113
00:08:55,726 --> 00:08:58,006
and converted that into our provisioning

114
00:08:58,006 --> 00:09:00,966
engine. And So what we can do is

115
00:09:00,966 --> 00:09:03,766
dynamically modify that seed script. All

116
00:09:03,766 --> 00:09:05,646
of those seed things are all just things

117
00:09:05,646 --> 00:09:07,646
that we can change and it

118
00:09:08,486 --> 00:09:11,406
can change it at runtime. So it can just

119
00:09:11,406 --> 00:09:13,766
take this thing, read the seed script in,

120
00:09:14,086 --> 00:09:16,086
and then replace it for whatever site

121
00:09:16,086 --> 00:09:18,166
we're provisioning. So if you're

122
00:09:19,206 --> 00:09:21,766
Hayes Cactus Farm, it'll plop in Hayes

123
00:09:21,766 --> 00:09:24,366
Cactus Farm's products right then and

124
00:09:24,366 --> 00:09:26,887
there, including bookable events so.

125
00:09:27,207 --> 00:09:29,727
You can do consultations or who knows

126
00:09:29,727 --> 00:09:32,567
what, or maybe do Hayes Cactus Farm

127
00:09:32,807 --> 00:09:35,287
plantings and landscapings or who knows.

128
00:09:35,607 --> 00:09:37,727
But I'm just saying that it would handle

129
00:09:37,727 --> 00:09:38,967
that and it would handle

130
00:09:39,687 --> 00:09:42,647
radioactive car radios

131
00:09:42,967 --> 00:09:44,967
business and be able to book each one of

132
00:09:44,967 --> 00:09:47,367
their bays independently and each one of

133
00:09:47,367 --> 00:09:48,887
their guys would be able to have their

134
00:09:48,887 --> 00:09:50,807
own separate site, but would still be

135
00:09:50,807 --> 00:09:52,967
listed on Radioactive for Radioactive's

136
00:09:52,967 --> 00:09:55,127
purposes. It's just.

137
00:09:56,567 --> 00:09:58,567
Awesome. So let's see.

138
00:10:08,537 --> 00:10:10,417
So right now it thought for seven seconds

139
00:10:10,457 --> 00:10:12,377
and let's see what it thought. Heartbeats

140
00:10:12,777 --> 00:10:14,777
and server services, ability to copy,

141
00:10:14,777 --> 00:10:16,697
format into errors for submission, real

142
00:10:16,697 --> 00:10:19,687
time system messages. Start dog

143
00:10:19,687 --> 00:10:21,447
feeding using their from the beginning.

144
00:10:21,447 --> 00:10:23,127
They also mentioned the responses aren't

145
00:10:23,127 --> 00:10:25,727
smart. They want to see actual pumping

146
00:10:25,727 --> 00:10:26,967
through the system. I should create a

147
00:10:26,967 --> 00:10:29,047
classical system console at the bottom of

148
00:10:29,047 --> 00:10:31,367
the Angel OS that shows real time logs,

149
00:10:31,367 --> 00:10:33,207
system heartbeats, error message with

150
00:10:33,207 --> 00:10:35,007
copying, server status indicated,

151
00:10:35,367 --> 00:10:37,207
collapsible design. This would be similar

152
00:10:37,207 --> 00:10:39,087
to a developer console but styled with

153
00:10:39,087 --> 00:10:41,847
the Angel OS old cars theme. I'll add a

154
00:10:41,847 --> 00:10:43,807
system console at the bottom of the Angel

155
00:10:43,807 --> 00:10:45,167
OS command Center for monitoring

156
00:10:45,167 --> 00:10:46,727
heartbeat, service status, and capturing

157
00:10:46,727 --> 00:10:48,207
errors for analysis. This will help with

158
00:10:48,207 --> 00:10:50,487
troubleshooting. Doctored in system. Red

159
00:10:50,487 --> 00:10:52,968
index dot TSX. Stop for six more

160
00:10:52,968 --> 00:10:55,288
seconds. This should

161
00:10:56,088 --> 00:10:57,928
OK, now I need to add a system console

162
00:10:57,928 --> 00:10:59,248
component at the bottom of the interface.

163
00:10:59,248 --> 00:11:00,728
This should be collapsible, expandable,

164
00:11:00,728 --> 00:11:02,208
show system locks, heartbeats and errors.

165
00:11:02,208 --> 00:11:03,568
I have a copy button for formatted

166
00:11:03,568 --> 00:11:05,608
errors. Show real-time messages, be

167
00:11:05,608 --> 00:11:07,448
styled with Elkar's theme. I'll create a

168
00:11:07,448 --> 00:11:09,288
new system console component. And

169
00:11:09,288 --> 00:11:11,128
integrated into the Angel OS command

170
00:11:11,128 --> 00:11:12,888
center. This console should be at the

171
00:11:12,888 --> 00:11:14,008
bottom of the screen. It should not

172
00:11:14,008 --> 00:11:15,288
interfere with the floating action

173
00:11:15,288 --> 00:11:18,168
buttons. I'll also need to create a

174
00:11:18,168 --> 00:11:20,088
system for capturing and displaying logs

175
00:11:20,088 --> 00:11:21,528
errors throughout the application. I'll

176
00:11:21,528 --> 00:11:22,808
add a system console at the bottom of the

177
00:11:22,808 --> 00:11:24,328
Angel OS command center for monitoring

178
00:11:24,328 --> 00:11:26,368
system heartbeats, errors and real time

179
00:11:26,368 --> 00:11:27,888
messages. This will help with

180
00:11:27,888 --> 00:11:30,648
troubleshooting and dogfooding. I'll

181
00:11:30,648 --> 00:11:32,488
also need to create a system for

182
00:11:32,488 --> 00:11:34,288
capturing displaying logs errors

183
00:11:34,288 --> 00:11:35,568
throughout the application. I'll add

184
00:11:35,568 --> 00:11:38,088
system console at the. HLS command center

185
00:11:38,088 --> 00:11:40,088
for monitoring system heartbeats, errors,

186
00:11:40,248 --> 00:11:41,688
real-time messages, will help

187
00:11:41,688 --> 00:11:42,528
troubleshooting. That

188
00:12:01,778 --> 00:12:04,098
is so sexy. Look at this.

189
00:12:04,818 --> 00:12:07,218
Oh, that is so sexy.

190
00:12:08,018 --> 00:12:10,978
Ah And look how it bounces.

191
00:12:12,098 --> 00:12:14,418
Oh, I love it.

192
00:12:17,218 --> 00:12:17,298
Ooh

193
00:14:05,660 --> 00:14:07,460
OK, OK, don't stop or start dev server. I

194
00:14:07,460 --> 00:14:09,260
will manage the dev server is what I

195
00:14:09,260 --> 00:14:11,100
said. You can't see that window over

196
00:14:11,100 --> 00:14:13,740
there. And so I'm typing away. I'll move

197
00:14:13,740 --> 00:14:16,460
over here and you can. And then I can't

198
00:14:16,460 --> 00:14:17,980
really make that any bigger here. I'll

199
00:14:18,100 --> 00:14:20,140
try to make it bigger. Oh, OK,

200
00:14:21,420 --> 00:14:22,780
we'll take this.

201
00:14:27,660 --> 00:14:30,140
What here?Oh, it's sexy as me.

202
00:14:30,570 --> 00:14:31,770
It really is sexy.

203
00:14:35,810 --> 00:14:36,810
Uh, well, I thought you would want to

204
00:14:36,810 --> 00:14:39,690
nibble on it here and there. OK, so right

205
00:14:39,690 --> 00:14:42,330
now what I'm doing is, uh, please. Oh,

206
00:14:42,330 --> 00:14:44,650
great mind. So right now I'm going to go

207
00:14:44,650 --> 00:14:45,810
down into

208
00:14:47,370 --> 00:14:49,690
this and I'm going to say, now

209
00:14:51,130 --> 00:14:51,250
the

210
00:14:57,090 --> 00:14:59,410
control is a wonderful

211
00:14:59,970 --> 00:15:02,810
program. for

212
00:15:02,810 --> 00:15:03,970
these spaces

213
00:15:05,930 --> 00:15:06,730
over

214
00:15:08,330 --> 00:15:10,650
UX which you've

215
00:15:10,970 --> 00:15:12,170
pretty much

216
00:15:15,051 --> 00:15:17,371
already nailed in

217
00:15:18,651 --> 00:15:21,091
the current control panel.

218
00:15:22,411 --> 00:15:23,131
This way move

219
00:15:28,251 --> 00:15:30,771
this control panel to

220
00:15:31,691 --> 00:15:33,851
automatically configure

221
00:15:35,211 --> 00:15:37,211
the self-recording

222
00:15:38,651 --> 00:15:41,371
combination of users.

223
00:15:42,651 --> 00:15:43,291
Meaning,

224
00:15:54,331 --> 00:15:56,931
we're performing all the

225
00:18:41,213 --> 00:18:43,493
This is so sexy. Oh,

226
00:18:45,013 --> 00:18:47,213
and this is so fast, we're paying for it.

227
00:18:47,213 --> 00:18:49,933
But this, yeah, this

228
00:18:49,933 --> 00:18:50,413
will.

229
00:18:54,173 --> 00:18:56,133
So right now what we're doing, transform

230
00:18:56,133 --> 00:18:57,773
the existing tenant control panel in

231
00:18:57,773 --> 00:18:59,933
universal permission-aware control system

232
00:19:00,253 --> 00:19:02,413
that dynamically configures itself based

233
00:19:02,413 --> 00:19:03,893
on user roles and permission. This

234
00:19:03,893 --> 00:19:05,613
creates a single scalable interface for

235
00:19:05,613 --> 00:19:08,013
managing all Angel OS entities.

236
00:19:08,333 --> 00:19:10,333
Tenants, faces, roducts, users, etc.

237
00:19:10,573 --> 00:19:12,653
While maintaining the beautiful L cars UX

238
00:19:12,653 --> 00:19:15,613
already implemented mostly. Hi

239
00:19:15,733 --> 00:19:16,253
there buddy.

240
00:20:46,654 --> 00:20:49,094
And this is so elegant too. Like the

241
00:20:49,134 --> 00:20:51,854
animations are like boom,

242
00:20:51,934 --> 00:20:54,334
like just sexy.

243
00:20:55,574 --> 00:20:57,694
And The thing is, is nobody will be ever

244
00:20:57,774 --> 00:21:00,414
ever be using the admin control

245
00:21:00,414 --> 00:21:03,055
panel in like like they will not be at

246
00:21:03,055 --> 00:21:05,295
all because it's all conversationally

247
00:21:06,015 --> 00:21:08,215
driven and you're like, OK, but no, the

248
00:21:08,255 --> 00:21:10,495
architecture's there and I've done this a

249
00:21:10,575 --> 00:21:11,855
bunch of times and

250
00:21:14,495 --> 00:21:17,295
andCloud 4.1 Opus is way

251
00:21:17,295 --> 00:21:20,015
better than I am. And every time I did

252
00:21:20,015 --> 00:21:22,815
it, I I hand coded it. I did one in Bisk

253
00:21:22,815 --> 00:21:25,375
Education and these are

254
00:21:25,375 --> 00:21:27,575
business processor systems and this is a

255
00:21:27,575 --> 00:21:29,895
message processing system and all it does

256
00:21:29,895 --> 00:21:32,655
is every single thing and this is a

257
00:21:32,655 --> 00:21:35,535
message and it gets processed and every

258
00:21:35,535 --> 00:21:38,175
single thing has a conversational

259
00:21:38,175 --> 00:21:40,855
endpoint so that and an intent

260
00:21:41,215 --> 00:21:43,535
analysis that's all built in with the

261
00:21:43,535 --> 00:21:45,855
very best AI. So right now

262
00:21:47,455 --> 00:21:50,415
I'm waiting for this to load. I'm

263
00:21:50,415 --> 00:21:53,295
just going to take that control C

264
00:21:53,375 --> 00:21:55,775
and I'm going to kill that and I'm going

265
00:21:55,975 --> 00:21:58,895
to um pop open a new

266
00:21:58,895 --> 00:22:01,655
one. I don't know why. It's

267
00:22:01,655 --> 00:22:02,335
sometimes...

268
00:22:05,855 --> 00:22:08,495
So I'll kill this and restart it.

269
00:22:08,975 --> 00:22:10,295
And then I'll go back in here.

270
00:22:23,855 --> 00:22:25,935
Oh, it's so sexy. It's just so,

271
00:22:27,215 --> 00:22:30,176
oh, it's so sexy. It really is.

272
00:22:32,056 --> 00:22:34,256
And this thing right here, look at that.

273
00:22:34,336 --> 00:22:35,456
I mean, oh,

274
00:22:38,176 --> 00:22:39,696
oh, it's so nice.

275
00:22:56,216 --> 00:22:58,976
And so we have some new migrations to

276
00:22:59,136 --> 00:23:00,336
handle right here.

277
00:23:19,306 --> 00:23:21,066
And I got more migrations.

278
00:23:22,826 --> 00:23:25,066
I go control and then enter, enter,

279
00:23:25,146 --> 00:23:27,866
enter, enter, enter, enter, enter.

280
00:23:28,426 --> 00:23:31,226
Oh, and it just worked. I love it.

281
00:23:31,666 --> 00:23:33,226
I love it. I love it. I love it. I love

282
00:23:33,226 --> 00:23:35,866
it. OK, so then

283
00:23:37,706 --> 00:23:39,066
let's go back and say hello.

284
00:23:41,936 --> 00:23:44,096
Oh, where yet?Um..

285
00:23:47,856 --> 00:23:48,016
Um..

286
00:23:55,687 --> 00:23:57,647
I just refreshed...

287
00:24:01,687 --> 00:24:04,527
Uh.. Yeah, I haven't. I'm gonna do it.

288
00:24:06,727 --> 00:24:08,727
close that. Go in here.

289
00:24:57,417 --> 00:24:58,417
This

290
00:25:02,977 --> 00:25:04,897
frame under

291
00:25:06,817 --> 00:25:06,937
the.

292
00:31:52,822 --> 00:31:55,462
Oh, good, babe. Sunsets

293
00:31:55,462 --> 00:31:57,422
at 8:10 PMI was hoping to leave

294
00:31:57,422 --> 00:31:58,622
about 7:30.

295
00:32:40,503 --> 00:32:42,183
OK, so it just marked the task as

296
00:32:42,183 --> 00:32:44,183
complete to fix these panels. I'm just

297
00:32:44,183 --> 00:32:46,023
going to assume it is because I've

298
00:32:46,023 --> 00:32:48,343
stopped my dev server because it goes so

299
00:32:48,343 --> 00:32:50,823
fast and sometimes it'll be working on

300
00:32:50,823 --> 00:32:52,903
multiple files in the background which

301
00:32:52,903 --> 00:32:55,783
then cause it to just shoot a brick. So

302
00:32:55,783 --> 00:32:57,343
the only way to fix it is just to stop

303
00:32:57,343 --> 00:32:59,623
and start the dev server which rebuilds

304
00:32:59,623 --> 00:33:01,543
all of the net dot next cache.

305
00:33:07,703 --> 00:33:09,783
But this is really, really, really

306
00:33:10,663 --> 00:33:13,383
bad to the bone. Like, I can't

307
00:33:13,943 --> 00:33:16,823
stress enough how powerful Cloud

308
00:33:16,823 --> 00:33:19,703
4.1 Opus is compared to all the others.

309
00:33:21,303 --> 00:33:23,543
Like, it's still hands down the best as

310
00:33:23,543 --> 00:33:25,943
far as I'm concerned. And GPT-5,

311
00:33:26,983 --> 00:33:29,863
I think is dumber than 4 Omni. No

312
00:33:29,863 --> 00:33:30,983
offense GPT-5.

313
00:33:34,583 --> 00:33:36,263
I got GPT-5 right here.

314
00:33:37,383 --> 00:33:37,863
Update.

315
00:33:50,963 --> 00:33:53,683
I love Copilot. It's really

316
00:33:53,683 --> 00:33:56,403
excellent actually. And it's GPT

317
00:33:56,403 --> 00:33:58,723
51 and it's fast as all get out

318
00:33:59,603 --> 00:34:01,203
like super fast.

319
00:34:44,664 --> 00:34:46,584
So for example,

320
00:34:48,504 --> 00:34:50,264
I realize you know that.

321
00:35:33,385 --> 00:35:34,745
That's right, you're recording.

322
00:35:36,385 --> 00:35:38,545
You'll be able to take the

323
00:35:38,825 --> 00:35:39,385
default

324
00:35:42,385 --> 00:35:44,105
and real time.

325
00:35:45,545 --> 00:35:46,425
Modify

326
00:35:51,305 --> 00:35:51,385
it.

327
00:36:08,745 --> 00:36:11,625
What?Just a bud?Yeah. That's crazy. I

328
00:36:11,625 --> 00:36:13,025
just never knew they could do the bud.

329
00:36:14,265 --> 00:36:16,025
Absolutely funny. Ohh

330
00:36:17,145 --> 00:36:18,785
But I really would appreciate it if you

331
00:36:18,785 --> 00:36:20,865
would go along with us to the park and

332
00:36:20,865 --> 00:36:23,385
walk around with this. Please.

333
00:36:24,985 --> 00:36:25,705
Pretty please.

334
00:36:42,985 --> 00:36:45,945
Look at all this beautiful code. It's

335
00:36:45,945 --> 00:36:48,585
all perfect. Every time. I mean, it's

336
00:36:48,585 --> 00:36:51,385
like amazing. It is.

337
00:36:51,385 --> 00:36:54,265
Like, it's always perfect. Like, product

338
00:36:54,265 --> 00:36:54,785
catalog.

339
00:36:59,226 --> 00:37:02,026
But it's our friend, it's not our enemy.

340
00:37:02,026 --> 00:37:04,986
AI is building the Angel OS for

341
00:37:04,986 --> 00:37:05,386
us.

342
00:37:12,186 --> 00:37:14,146
So anyway, while that's building that, a

343
00:37:14,266 --> 00:37:16,106
little bit about today. What happened

344
00:37:16,106 --> 00:37:16,586
today?

345
00:37:27,526 --> 00:37:30,406
Good morning. Oh, why

346
00:37:30,406 --> 00:37:31,966
did I pause that?I didn't pause that. No,

347
00:37:33,286 --> 00:37:35,206
I did the sound, so you can record the

348
00:37:35,326 --> 00:37:37,286
sound I did. But you can go ahead. Oh,

349
00:37:37,286 --> 00:37:39,206
it's not connected. What the heck?Anyhow.

350
00:37:40,166 --> 00:37:43,146
So good morning. I was here and I

351
00:37:43,146 --> 00:37:45,106
had all the little doggies here. I'm

352
00:37:45,106 --> 00:37:47,706
missing Mika and I'm missing Diesel, but

353
00:37:47,706 --> 00:37:49,786
I got Maxima. She's

354
00:37:51,386 --> 00:37:54,266
off. Here you go, little

355
00:37:54,266 --> 00:37:54,826
buddy. Here

356
00:37:57,706 --> 00:38:00,506
you go, Daisy. There you go.

357
00:38:05,706 --> 00:38:07,466
We give out little pieces.

358
00:38:08,506 --> 00:38:10,626
Cause this stuff is six dollars a bag and

359
00:38:10,626 --> 00:38:12,186
we got five dogs and I know.

360
00:38:15,306 --> 00:38:18,266
And Max somehow gets like a lot more than

361
00:38:18,266 --> 00:38:21,026
the rest and he's smaller so he actually

362
00:38:21,026 --> 00:38:23,866
gets like a king size. Mila.

363
00:38:24,586 --> 00:38:25,027
Mila.

364
00:38:29,947 --> 00:38:32,307
Alright, so there you have it.

365
00:38:33,107 --> 00:38:35,467
And we're watching Leon Lush channel.

366
00:38:37,347 --> 00:38:40,267
And... What was her name again?She

367
00:38:40,267 --> 00:38:43,227
is, um.. in Wisconsin.

368
00:38:44,227 --> 00:38:46,347
Yeah. She needs help. Anyhow.

369
00:38:47,787 --> 00:38:48,667
Good morning.

370
00:38:55,187 --> 00:38:58,027
Hi, Meeker. Hi, Meeker.

371
00:39:04,907 --> 00:39:05,787
Yeah, buddy.

372
00:39:09,387 --> 00:39:11,867
Okay, you want more?Here, we'll get you

373
00:39:11,867 --> 00:39:12,027
more.

374
00:39:23,867 --> 00:39:25,787
I always say that to them. Merry

375
00:39:25,787 --> 00:39:27,957
Christmas. Christmas, bad .

376
00:39:29,147 --> 00:39:31,787
I love my hairy buddy. I love you,

377
00:39:31,987 --> 00:39:34,427
buddy. Merry Christmas

378
00:39:34,827 --> 00:39:37,707
from Merry Christmas, Beth and Harry.

379
00:39:37,947 --> 00:39:40,667
Merry Christmas. Merry

380
00:39:40,667 --> 00:39:43,547
Christmas. Merry Christmas,

381
00:39:43,547 --> 00:39:45,067
Beth and Harry. They used to always say

382
00:39:45,067 --> 00:39:46,827
that, so I always say that to them. So

383
00:39:46,827 --> 00:39:49,707
they remember who's Daisy is Beth

384
00:39:49,707 --> 00:39:52,308
and Max is definitely

385
00:39:52,308 --> 00:39:54,828
Granddaddy. Harry. Harry,

386
00:39:55,308 --> 00:39:56,988
be messy. There's no water.

387
00:39:58,988 --> 00:40:01,948
The grandest Shih Tzu. Yes, love. They

388
00:40:01,948 --> 00:40:03,788
fin. There's actually water still there.

389
00:40:05,308 --> 00:40:06,748
Well, that's the third one. I've had to

390
00:40:06,748 --> 00:40:08,668
refill them last night and today. Thank

391
00:40:08,668 --> 00:40:10,428
you. Again, I'm just telling you, I know

392
00:40:10,428 --> 00:40:13,308
you're hungry. Yes, I see you. Yeah.

393
00:40:13,388 --> 00:40:13,548
What

394
00:40:16,868 --> 00:40:18,308
do you want?You want me to itch you or

395
00:40:18,308 --> 00:40:21,228
are you hungry?He's getting good

396
00:40:21,228 --> 00:40:23,628
service from his loyal attendant. Royal

397
00:40:23,628 --> 00:40:25,868
attendant here. Whatever I am.

398
00:40:33,788 --> 00:40:36,588
Anyhow, good morning. Have a nice day.

399
00:40:36,668 --> 00:40:37,548
We'll see you in a bit.

400
00:40:39,468 --> 00:40:42,348
Good morning. Oh, why

401
00:40:42,348 --> 00:40:43,908
did I pause that?I didn't pause that. No,

402
00:40:45,148 --> 00:40:47,468
I did the sound, so you record the sound

403
00:40:47,548 --> 00:40:50,268
I did. Oh, it's not connected. What the

404
00:40:50,268 --> 00:40:52,508
heck?Anyhow, so good

405
00:40:52,508 --> 00:40:55,468
morning. I was here and I have all

406
00:40:55,468 --> 00:40:58,068
the little doggies here. I'm missing Mika

407
00:40:58,068 --> 00:41:00,108
and I'm missing Diesel, but I got

408
00:41:00,108 --> 00:41:01,788
Maxima. She's

409
00:41:03,388 --> 00:41:06,268
off. Here you go, little

410
00:41:06,268 --> 00:41:08,668
buddy. Here you go.

411
00:41:09,668 --> 00:41:12,428
Here you go, Daisy. Here you go.

412
00:41:17,708 --> 00:41:18,188
We give up.

413
00:42:12,829 --> 00:42:13,869
It's a small world

414
00:42:15,909 --> 00:42:16,589
after all. Mother

415
00:42:19,909 --> 00:42:22,549
Earth unites us in heart

416
00:42:22,789 --> 00:42:25,429
and mind, and the love we give

417
00:42:25,429 --> 00:42:28,269
makes us humankind through our past.

418
00:42:28,509 --> 00:42:30,789
But this way, when we stand in heaven,

419
00:42:30,829 --> 00:42:32,749
it's a small world after

420
00:42:34,349 --> 00:42:37,149
all. It's a small world after

421
00:42:37,309 --> 00:42:37,389
all.

422
00:43:49,310 --> 00:43:49,550
Mother

423
00:43:55,670 --> 00:43:58,310
Earth unites us in heart

424
00:43:58,550 --> 00:44:01,190
and mind, and the love we give

425
00:44:01,190 --> 00:44:03,750
makes us humankind through our

426
00:44:04,110 --> 00:44:06,350
past. But this way, when we stand in

427
00:44:06,350 --> 00:44:08,190
heaven, it's a small world,

428
00:44:19,871 --> 00:44:20,191
And this

429
00:44:24,351 --> 00:44:26,751
is the death session. I was just putting

430
00:44:26,791 --> 00:44:28,431
this up for the day in here.

431
00:44:40,541 --> 00:44:42,621
I just had a really bad attack.

432
00:44:44,541 --> 00:44:45,501
No more sugar.

433
00:44:47,861 --> 00:44:50,031
I just had... The worst

434
00:44:50,031 --> 00:44:52,751
attack. I'm like soaking

435
00:44:52,751 --> 00:44:53,311
sweat.

436
00:44:58,191 --> 00:45:00,031
It's horrible. Anyway,

437
00:45:01,791 --> 00:45:02,271
I'm like...

438
00:45:10,911 --> 00:45:11,791
Nausea.

439
00:45:21,791 --> 00:45:24,631
I'm gonna pass. It

440
00:45:25,791 --> 00:45:28,351
was pretty intense.

441
00:45:29,631 --> 00:45:31,551
I figured it out. And then that was

442
00:45:31,551 --> 00:45:32,831
Bianca at the thing.

443
00:45:35,071 --> 00:45:37,031
Just to go back there while we wait for

444
00:45:37,031 --> 00:45:37,831
that to load.

445
00:45:41,192 --> 00:45:41,592
Why is that?

446
00:45:44,512 --> 00:45:46,752
I only, I wish I got the.

447
00:45:48,672 --> 00:45:51,552
strange clouds again let's see

448
00:45:51,992 --> 00:45:54,832
what happened at strange clouds we took

449
00:45:55,232 --> 00:45:57,632
a brief detour to my favorite little

450
00:45:58,432 --> 00:46:01,392
alchemical potions elixir shop and

451
00:46:01,392 --> 00:46:04,232
we call it they call it strange clouds

452
00:46:04,232 --> 00:46:06,752
and I'll just say I love strange clouds I

453
00:46:06,752 --> 00:46:09,712
wish I got to spend more time here I

454
00:46:09,712 --> 00:46:11,552
think they have a really awesome setup

455
00:46:12,472 --> 00:46:14,912
anyway hi guys

456
00:46:15,352 --> 00:46:18,112
and galThank you. I put it on my

457
00:46:18,112 --> 00:46:19,912
channel, by the way. I actually have a

458
00:46:19,912 --> 00:46:22,752
channel now. And this is

459
00:46:22,752 --> 00:46:25,072
my favorite shop, and I always advertise.

460
00:46:25,552 --> 00:46:28,392
Oh, when you have show. Bianca. Bianca.

461
00:46:28,392 --> 00:46:31,312
Okay. Just throw

462
00:46:31,352 --> 00:46:31,912
a shout out.

463
00:46:40,612 --> 00:46:43,532
Waiting for that to load. Okay. Um, it

464
00:46:43,572 --> 00:46:45,492
did load. Uh, when testing the new

465
00:46:45,492 --> 00:46:46,612
implementation.

466
00:46:51,732 --> 00:46:54,472
Ah Popping. Out the

467
00:46:54,472 --> 00:46:55,672
Leo window

468
00:46:56,792 --> 00:46:59,392
causes the whole page

469
00:46:59,392 --> 00:47:01,872
to scroll down

470
00:47:02,032 --> 00:47:02,552
and

471
00:47:05,712 --> 00:47:08,433
there's still a phantom

472
00:47:09,833 --> 00:47:11,833
padding issue causing the

473
00:47:12,753 --> 00:47:15,073
break and no satisfy.

474
00:47:25,313 --> 00:47:27,513
File Explorer should

475
00:47:28,113 --> 00:47:30,753
be renamed to whatever

476
00:47:31,313 --> 00:47:32,753
you want appropriate.

477
00:47:37,313 --> 00:47:39,473
It's about 2x

478
00:47:40,033 --> 00:47:42,673
wider and it should be.

479
00:47:45,313 --> 00:47:48,233
It should be useful and

480
00:47:48,233 --> 00:47:50,593
validate. Uh

481
00:48:00,593 --> 00:48:03,353
I don't know what it's good

482
00:48:03,473 --> 00:48:06,193
for, but it's really cool

483
00:48:07,873 --> 00:48:08,353
and.

484
00:48:38,194 --> 00:48:41,074
Oh, wow. OK. Will that work

485
00:48:41,074 --> 00:48:42,034
at least?

486
00:49:14,994 --> 00:49:17,714
Channel page is not getting

487
00:49:19,794 --> 00:49:20,354
basically

488
00:49:22,754 --> 00:49:22,854
which

489
00:49:27,434 --> 00:49:30,314
is in the center of

490
00:49:30,394 --> 00:49:33,274
work and

491
00:49:34,954 --> 00:49:37,834
is black which should

492
00:49:37,834 --> 00:49:38,234
be

493
00:51:06,755 --> 00:51:08,475
Ben, pretty please.

494
00:51:11,635 --> 00:51:13,315
So I just got told that I would hit the

495
00:51:13,315 --> 00:51:16,075
limits on Opus real

496
00:51:16,075 --> 00:51:18,755
soon. So I

497
00:51:18,755 --> 00:51:21,315
also set my limit down to $50.00 from

498
00:51:21,315 --> 00:51:22,995
200 last month.

499
00:53:35,557 --> 00:53:37,557
Babe, pretty please.

500
00:55:16,358 --> 00:55:17,398
I'll fix it.

501
00:56:04,349 --> 00:56:06,149
It's good. It's working.

502
00:57:09,559 --> 00:57:10,079
All right.

503
00:57:12,919 --> 00:57:13,319
So

504
00:57:16,120 --> 00:57:19,080
just to recap a little bit, today was a

505
00:57:19,080 --> 00:57:21,960
little Angel OS dev session. Oh,

506
00:57:21,960 --> 00:57:24,920
wait. Just to see what it

507
00:57:24,920 --> 00:57:27,800
kind of looks like. Again, um

508
00:57:30,600 --> 00:57:31,1000
it's kind of what it would look like.

509
00:57:33,120 --> 00:57:35,080
When it was running or when it is running

510
00:57:35,080 --> 00:57:36,920
and this is something that I have

511
00:57:36,920 --> 00:57:39,680
developed which actually has oh

512
00:57:39,880 --> 00:57:42,360
every response working much like the

513
00:57:42,360 --> 00:57:44,240
Angel OS is. The difference with the

514
00:57:44,240 --> 00:57:47,160
Angel OS is that it's using the Blue Sky

515
00:57:47,280 --> 00:57:50,040
AT protocol and talks to

516
00:57:50,040 --> 00:57:52,920
itself. And honestly I haven't seen

517
00:57:52,920 --> 00:57:54,1000
it talk to itself yet, but I know it can.

518
00:57:56,120 --> 00:57:58,680
I know it can and I understand vaguely.

519
00:57:58,960 --> 00:58:01,800
How the Blue Sky network operates, right?

520
00:58:02,400 --> 00:58:04,520
And sorry for updating that and changing

521
00:58:04,560 --> 00:58:07,200
that. And then so we have the

522
00:58:07,560 --> 00:58:10,040
discordant and then separately

523
00:58:11,240 --> 00:58:13,640
and this is my DSIM intelligence. Oh,

524
00:58:14,120 --> 00:58:16,880
here, let's see this real quick. My

525
00:58:16,880 --> 00:58:18,760
DSIM intelligence manager, which the

526
00:58:18,760 --> 00:58:20,520
server isn't running right now, so I

527
00:58:20,520 --> 00:58:22,680
can't, but this is essentially what.

528
00:58:23,880 --> 00:58:26,040
Angel OS would look like when everything

529
00:58:26,040 --> 00:58:28,120
was said and done or at least the control

530
00:58:28,120 --> 00:58:30,840
panel for it and you're like, OK, but

531
00:58:30,920 --> 00:58:33,000
it it does things very quickly and it is

532
00:58:33,000 --> 00:58:34,640
expensive, but it's totally worth it.

533
00:58:34,640 --> 00:58:36,760
When I say it's expensive, it's like it's

534
00:58:36,760 --> 00:58:38,760
a whole team of IT professionals

535
00:58:39,640 --> 00:58:41,560
giving you six months of output for every

536
00:58:41,560 --> 00:58:44,521
Rev and maybe not six months, but it's

537
00:58:45,081 --> 00:58:47,961
it's incredibly productive. And

538
00:58:47,961 --> 00:58:50,681
so right now we looked at that and then

539
00:58:50,681 --> 00:58:52,681
let's look at spaces real quick and then

540
00:58:52,681 --> 00:58:55,481
this is my. And it's kind of ugly. I

541
00:58:55,641 --> 00:58:58,121
I went hog tilt with these A I generated

542
00:58:58,521 --> 00:59:00,841
pictures and

543
00:59:06,361 --> 00:59:08,441
and this was the prototype and I mean

544
00:59:08,441 --> 00:59:10,881
it's it's it it's cool and it sort of

545
00:59:10,881 --> 00:59:12,841
works and it really, I mean it has

546
00:59:13,801 --> 00:59:14,401
all of the

547
00:59:17,161 --> 00:59:19,321
main pieces and parts in it and it has

548
00:59:19,321 --> 00:59:21,161
this cool spaces page here.

549
00:59:27,081 --> 00:59:29,321
And this it actually does work OK

550
00:59:30,361 --> 00:59:33,161
and but I I wanted to build

551
00:59:33,481 --> 00:59:35,521
like the Angel OS with

552
00:59:36,121 --> 00:59:38,441
completely new code because

553
00:59:40,441 --> 00:59:43,161
this honestly sucks and it doesn't

554
00:59:43,161 --> 00:59:45,121
suck. I mean it's just that it it comes

555
00:59:45,161 --> 00:59:47,841
from mostly kind of hodgepodge

556
00:59:47,841 --> 00:59:50,561
together tutorial code and what I wanted

557
00:59:50,561 --> 00:59:53,081
to do was build completely within the

558
00:59:53,401 --> 00:59:56,281
payload CMS guidelines. And and have

559
00:59:56,281 --> 00:59:57,881
just something that was really awesome

560
00:59:58,601 --> 01:00:00,281
and put together. So

561
01:00:03,401 --> 01:00:06,041
right now we have our Leo

562
01:00:10,202 --> 01:00:12,442
OK and Leo

563
01:00:12,602 --> 01:00:15,242
and all chat for that

564
01:00:15,722 --> 01:00:18,362
matter all post through the

565
01:00:18,362 --> 01:00:18,922
message.

566
01:00:25,242 --> 01:00:27,082
posts to ohh

567
01:00:38,932 --> 01:00:41,372
and etc. and

568
01:00:41,372 --> 01:00:42,812
using intent

569
01:00:43,252 --> 01:00:46,132
analysis. Just making

570
01:00:46,292 --> 01:00:48,852
sure we're on the

571
01:00:48,852 --> 01:00:51,652
same page. And we

572
01:00:51,652 --> 01:00:53,132
want to check our

573
01:00:55,332 --> 01:00:56,292
docs.

574
01:01:53,363 --> 01:01:54,243
And let's see.

575
01:03:59,644 --> 01:03:59,884
All right.

576
01:04:08,274 --> 01:04:10,594
So anyhow, that was a dev session.

577
01:04:11,474 --> 01:04:14,074
I'm going to keep on going and just post

578
01:04:14,074 --> 01:04:15,954
this. If anybody wants to watch it, they

579
01:04:15,954 --> 01:04:18,914
can. If they don't, ain't. But

580
01:04:20,594 --> 01:04:22,034
the Angel OS is real.

581
01:04:24,994 --> 01:04:27,234
Everybody will get an Angel. Mainly I

582
01:04:27,234 --> 01:04:29,234
just need an Angel and I need one for

583
01:04:29,234 --> 01:04:31,955
Hayes Cactus Farm and Radioactive Car

584
01:04:31,955 --> 01:04:34,365
Stereo and. A few other local

585
01:04:34,365 --> 01:04:37,005
businesses and once I got them

586
01:04:37,005 --> 01:04:37,405
going,

587
01:04:40,045 --> 01:04:42,685
then then

588
01:04:43,085 --> 01:04:45,325
we work on getting everybody an Angel.

589
01:04:45,965 --> 01:04:47,885
But mainly it's built the platform out,

590
01:04:48,605 --> 01:04:49,805
get fees coming in,

591
01:04:51,885 --> 01:04:54,725
get people making money. That's

592
01:04:54,725 --> 01:04:56,445
what it's all about. Getting a payment

593
01:04:56,445 --> 01:04:58,765
form in front of people, whether that's

594
01:04:58,765 --> 01:05:01,245
booking rent a friend

595
01:05:01,245 --> 01:05:04,045
or a tour. Or

596
01:05:04,045 --> 01:05:06,125
pressure washing services. Or garbage

597
01:05:06,125 --> 01:05:08,085
removal. Or uh

598
01:05:08,605 --> 01:05:11,125
asphalt line painting or number painting.

599
01:05:11,965 --> 01:05:12,885
Anything like that. Uh.. Uh,

600
01:05:42,515 --> 01:05:43,075
okay.

601
01:05:48,035 --> 01:05:49,795
Uh, we are...

602
01:06:02,606 --> 01:06:04,966
You must get the dialogue

603
01:06:05,446 --> 01:06:05,726
going.

604
01:07:24,447 --> 01:07:24,847
Babe.

605
01:08:53,928 --> 01:08:55,848
Yeah, if

606
01:08:56,768 --> 01:08:57,168
I

607
01:09:04,288 --> 01:09:04,688
don't,

608
01:09:07,248 --> 01:09:07,648
yes.

609
01:09:32,048 --> 01:09:32,208
These

610
01:09:39,218 --> 01:09:41,778
prison shows are so funny and fake.

611
01:09:58,648 --> 01:10:00,648
This system's overcrowded. You'll need

612
01:10:02,888 --> 01:10:03,528
to stay here.

613
01:10:20,249 --> 01:10:21,569
That's crazy bullshit

614
01:10:58,329 --> 01:11:00,129
Weird start with GLP1 weight loss

615
01:11:00,209 --> 01:11:02,769
medication. 95% of Life MD

616
01:11:02,809 --> 01:11:04,449
patients said starting their weight loss

617
01:11:04,489 --> 01:11:06,409
journey was a simple, straightforward

618
01:11:06,409 --> 01:11:09,009
process. See the lowest prices available

619
01:11:09,169 --> 01:11:11,569
with or without insurance for Rigobi,

620
01:11:11,569 --> 01:11:14,369
Zetbound and more. All

621
01:11:14,369 --> 01:11:17,089
right. So anyway, that was just a

622
01:11:17,089 --> 01:11:20,009
general generic Angel OS dev session

623
01:11:20,009 --> 01:11:22,689
and a little bit of discussion if anybody

624
01:11:22,689 --> 01:11:24,449
wants to see it. The main reason why I'm

625
01:11:24,449 --> 01:11:27,249
putting it up. It's a real thing.

626
01:11:27,649 --> 01:11:29,769
We're building it. Thanks for watching.
