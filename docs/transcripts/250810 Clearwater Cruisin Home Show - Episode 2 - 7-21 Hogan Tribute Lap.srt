1
00:00:01,440 --> 00:00:04,000
Good evening, everyone. It is

2
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:06,200
Sunday, August the 10th,

3
00:00:06,200 --> 00:00:07,520
2025.

4
00:00:08,800 --> 00:00:11,120
48 p.m. or 19:48 p.m.

5
00:00:11,440 --> 00:00:14,240
Eastern Time. Anyway, I'm

6
00:00:14,960 --> 00:00:17,000
looking at some dashcam footage in there.

7
00:00:17,520 --> 00:00:19,400
So this is a short update for the

8
00:00:19,440 --> 00:00:21,680
channel, but I'm looking at some dashcam

9
00:00:21,680 --> 00:00:24,560
footage. This is after... Keep in mind,

10
00:00:24,560 --> 00:00:27,040
I was... I had just been

11
00:00:27,320 --> 00:00:30,200
like threatened with my life anyway, and

12
00:00:30,200 --> 00:00:32,480
I realize that for most of you, but I was

13
00:00:32,480 --> 00:00:34,400
like pretty surprised that I was

14
00:00:35,280 --> 00:00:37,760
so nonchalant about it given the

15
00:00:37,760 --> 00:00:40,400
circumstances, etc. So all I'm saying is

16
00:00:40,800 --> 00:00:42,880
this is oops wrong one here.

17
00:00:43,800 --> 00:00:46,720
Okay. Uh, I think I've got that

18
00:00:46,720 --> 00:00:48,200
down. Okay. Uh,

19
00:00:50,640 --> 00:00:52,800
all right. So on with this show. Let's

20
00:00:53,520 --> 00:00:56,400
check this out. Uh, I

21
00:00:56,400 --> 00:00:58,921
gotta go over here... We call it

22
00:00:59,361 --> 00:01:02,281
our circle of life Or the circle

23
00:01:02,281 --> 00:01:04,801
of life And we do our

24
00:01:04,801 --> 00:01:07,761
Hakuna Matata A song

25
00:01:07,841 --> 00:01:10,361
about enterprise dog park

26
00:01:10,721 --> 00:01:13,441
In Clearwater, Florida, where I take

27
00:01:13,681 --> 00:01:15,681
me to Daisy and Max To

28
00:01:16,641 --> 00:01:19,161
play the part just last, and when we walk

29
00:01:19,761 --> 00:01:22,561
We call it our circle of life

30
00:01:23,281 --> 00:01:24,481
Or circle

31
00:02:20,201 --> 00:02:22,761
Bama Tata, Playwater,

32
00:02:22,801 --> 00:02:25,121
Florida, where I take Nika

33
00:02:25,121 --> 00:02:28,081
Daisy and Max to play. The park is

34
00:02:28,201 --> 00:02:30,921
fast and when we walk we call it our

35
00:02:30,921 --> 00:02:33,201
circle of life, or a

36
00:02:33,201 --> 00:02:35,921
circle of life. And we do

37
00:02:35,921 --> 00:02:38,001
our Hakuna Matata,

38
00:02:39,121 --> 00:02:41,761
a song about Enterprise Dog Park

39
00:02:42,161 --> 00:02:45,121
in Clearwater, Florida, where I take

40
00:02:45,441 --> 00:02:47,121
Nika Daisy and Max.

41
00:03:27,042 --> 00:03:29,482
Oh, here's my neighbor looking at me like

42
00:03:29,522 --> 00:03:32,162
I'm all crazy, since I am all day.

43
00:03:33,682 --> 00:03:35,922
To play the part, it's faster when we

44
00:03:35,922 --> 00:03:38,522
walk We call it a

45
00:03:39,242 --> 00:03:41,602
circle or a circle

46
00:03:47,842 --> 00:03:48,322
That was.

47
00:05:10,163 --> 00:05:12,843
I was in a lot of places. You understand

48
00:05:12,843 --> 00:05:15,683
that Butthead Neighbor, like

49
00:05:15,963 --> 00:05:17,603
it's been an ongoing day and literally

50
00:05:17,723 --> 00:05:19,723
flashed the freaking knife in the sand

51
00:05:19,723 --> 00:05:21,603
right right there on the screen. You can

52
00:05:21,603 --> 00:05:23,883
see it's right up there.

53
00:05:24,803 --> 00:05:27,043
And I literally had nothing. I mean, like

54
00:05:27,403 --> 00:05:29,763
nothing. My Cadillac right there on the

55
00:05:30,643 --> 00:05:30,963
screen.

56
00:05:35,603 --> 00:05:36,243
No Navy.

57
00:05:41,043 --> 00:05:43,283
I said, I ain't askin' You ain't begging

58
00:05:43,323 --> 00:05:45,843
for peace Just don't lie to me and

59
00:05:45,843 --> 00:05:48,523
reproduce Don't ever cease He said, no,

60
00:05:48,883 --> 00:05:51,363
don't, but here's the curse You ain't the

61
00:05:51,363 --> 00:05:53,683
monster yet, but you're rehearsed

62
00:05:54,803 --> 00:05:55,963
All right, guys.

63
00:06:31,123 --> 00:06:32,883
We wanted to get the whole thing in

64
00:06:32,883 --> 00:06:33,763
there, by the way.

65
00:06:39,123 --> 00:06:40,963
I was just trying to get an extra sign

66
00:06:41,043 --> 00:06:43,323
sign. 'Cause my neighbors, they like to

67
00:06:43,323 --> 00:06:46,043
turn their radios up all the time and out

68
00:06:46,043 --> 00:06:48,083
the parking lot. And honestly, that

69
00:06:48,083 --> 00:06:49,923
really wasn't that loud out there

70
00:06:50,203 --> 00:06:52,964
compared to those radios. Nah, it was

71
00:06:52,964 --> 00:06:55,684
nothing compared to the music. No hard

72
00:06:55,684 --> 00:06:58,124
feelings. I was just having fun doing his

73
00:06:58,324 --> 00:06:58,644
radios.

74
00:07:05,364 --> 00:07:05,524
'Cause

75
00:07:14,604 --> 00:07:16,884
there's other things, like the story that

76
00:07:16,884 --> 00:07:18,964
I knew what my fifth element is, right?

77
00:07:25,124 --> 00:07:28,084
Mika needs to go upstairs. That's

78
00:07:28,164 --> 00:07:30,124
the best song ever. Now I just dedicated

79
00:07:30,124 --> 00:07:32,724
that to you, but you can come out.

80
00:07:33,764 --> 00:07:36,004
I'm taking Miko. Will you go with me?No!

81
00:07:37,124 --> 00:07:38,484
I'm not coming back down here, please.

82
00:07:38,804 --> 00:07:41,644
Okay, see you later, Alligator. I'm on a

83
00:07:41,644 --> 00:07:44,004
mission. I want to go on a mission! It

84
00:07:44,644 --> 00:07:47,604
is a perfect day outside. It is still

85
00:07:47,684 --> 00:07:50,404
traumatized from her aborted sisters

86
00:07:50,644 --> 00:07:52,484
that are living in her body right now.

87
00:07:52,724 --> 00:07:55,484
And my aborted daughter. Yeah, that's

88
00:07:55,724 --> 00:07:58,364
real. Hey, I'll give you three

89
00:07:58,604 --> 00:07:58,924
minutes.

90
00:08:01,924 --> 00:08:04,084
all twisted up in the three muses that

91
00:08:04,124 --> 00:08:06,564
are the fifth element or my girlfriend.

92
00:08:08,004 --> 00:08:10,364
All makes perfect sense to me. And if you

93
00:08:10,364 --> 00:08:12,764
read my journal, you can pretty much find

94
00:08:12,764 --> 00:08:14,884
out for yourself. So this is us talking

95
00:08:14,884 --> 00:08:16,724
about before I go on the mission. What am

96
00:08:16,724 --> 00:08:18,524
I going on?I'm going on a soul quest

97
00:08:18,564 --> 00:08:20,804
here. I'm just looking for

98
00:08:21,604 --> 00:08:23,124
somebody to quit Bika.

99
00:08:55,205 --> 00:08:56,645
Never had a chance to go out with their

100
00:08:56,645 --> 00:08:57,285
big brother.

101
00:09:09,205 --> 00:09:12,005
This is down Drew Street in Clearwater.

102
00:09:19,285 --> 00:09:21,205
I'm uploading this whole thing right now,

103
00:09:21,285 --> 00:09:23,685
but it's really, really slow. And this

104
00:09:23,685 --> 00:09:26,565
one's like 81 gigabytes, actually.

105
00:09:28,565 --> 00:09:30,645
So, and and I wanted to get the whole

106
00:09:30,645 --> 00:09:32,365
thing up because this is kind of like

107
00:09:32,365 --> 00:09:35,285
group, but this is the trauma that

108
00:09:35,285 --> 00:09:37,365
I was experiencing from that whole

109
00:09:37,365 --> 00:09:39,885
assault from that weep shit

110
00:09:40,645 --> 00:09:43,045
excuse me, that weep person that lives in

111
00:09:43,045 --> 00:09:45,285
my neighborhood. that pretends to be a

112
00:09:45,285 --> 00:09:47,125
former coach, even though

113
00:09:48,245 --> 00:09:50,245
we see no actual evidence of it other

114
00:09:50,245 --> 00:09:51,965
than the little placard on the front of

115
00:09:51,965 --> 00:09:52,845
his car. Uh

116
00:09:55,605 --> 00:09:56,925
Just pointing out

117
00:10:00,325 --> 00:10:03,045
all our feelings are gone. Welcome to the

118
00:10:03,045 --> 00:10:05,205
club, but all your

119
00:10:05,525 --> 00:10:07,685
behavior is indicative of

120
00:10:10,885 --> 00:10:13,125
not serving, as far as I

121
00:10:14,165 --> 00:10:17,045
Anyway, let's just hope that

122
00:10:17,605 --> 00:10:18,645
I'm wrong. And

123
00:10:20,645 --> 00:10:22,365
you aren't like stalling dollars type,

124
00:10:22,365 --> 00:10:24,045
but definitely doing a lot of

125
00:10:25,205 --> 00:10:28,165
research on that point. You got a

126
00:10:28,165 --> 00:10:30,045
lot of people looking at that, by the

127
00:10:30,045 --> 00:10:32,725
way. I'm just a laden

128
00:10:34,885 --> 00:10:35,445
young man.

129
00:11:12,006 --> 00:11:12,086
We

130
00:11:14,886 --> 00:11:17,766
got Easel, we got Liza, we

131
00:11:17,766 --> 00:11:20,646
got Max, we got Daisy, we

132
00:11:20,806 --> 00:11:21,846
got Mika.

133
00:11:26,326 --> 00:11:28,846
They all fitting is so bad. It's kind of

134
00:11:28,846 --> 00:11:31,246
hard to get them into the other one

135
00:11:33,886 --> 00:11:34,126
anyway.

136
00:11:38,406 --> 00:11:40,206
This is me talking to this homeless

137
00:11:40,286 --> 00:11:43,046
person at the Serenity place in clearorder

138
00:11:47,526 --> 00:11:48,446
here. Right here, look.

139
00:11:51,366 --> 00:11:51,926
Uh oh.

140
00:11:56,806 --> 00:11:57,286
All right.

141
00:12:02,686 --> 00:12:04,406
So I ended up talking to this guy. He

142
00:12:04,406 --> 00:12:05,926
wouldn't want to get on camera, but I

143
00:12:05,926 --> 00:12:07,606
have been interviewing him at this

144
00:12:07,606 --> 00:12:10,406
approximate time. And actually, we

145
00:12:12,526 --> 00:12:15,246
could... And we can

146
00:12:15,246 --> 00:12:16,966
look over at our,

147
00:12:21,446 --> 00:12:24,326
um.. Ah, here. And

148
00:12:24,486 --> 00:12:26,486
we're gonna go into here.

149
00:12:29,366 --> 00:12:30,886
UhOh.

150
00:12:39,766 --> 00:12:40,566
Refresh it.

151
00:12:49,047 --> 00:12:51,527
It will take a while. Oh, there you go.

152
00:12:51,847 --> 00:12:53,447
And you're wondering why I have that

153
00:12:53,447 --> 00:12:56,327
here. This is the dogs.

154
00:13:03,367 --> 00:13:05,767
Hi, Mila. How are you?

155
00:13:07,367 --> 00:13:08,807
How'd you get here?

156
00:13:10,727 --> 00:13:13,047
Hi, Diesel. How are you?

157
00:13:15,207 --> 00:13:18,087
Anyhow, Mila and Diesel, there's

158
00:13:18,087 --> 00:13:20,247
some med stocks. The med's staying with

159
00:13:20,287 --> 00:13:21,447
us for a short while.

160
00:13:26,847 --> 00:13:28,647
Also, I had a really cool little thing

161
00:13:28,647 --> 00:13:31,567
today at Wally World. by the way,

162
00:13:31,567 --> 00:13:33,847
before we get back to the other

163
00:13:35,687 --> 00:13:37,687
thing. All is good. Ohh

164
00:13:39,487 --> 00:13:41,287
He just, I don't know if he really wanted

165
00:13:41,287 --> 00:13:43,127
treats or if he was checking out that one

166
00:13:43,127 --> 00:13:45,287
chip. I don't know.

167
00:13:46,127 --> 00:13:48,847
Look at him. He's intrigued. He's just

168
00:13:48,887 --> 00:13:50,367
getting the bacon, but you got to make

169
00:13:50,367 --> 00:13:53,207
them last three days, damn it. Tell

170
00:13:55,607 --> 00:13:56,127
them that.

171
00:14:03,047 --> 00:14:04,687
Hi. Here you go. Come here. All right.

172
00:14:04,687 --> 00:14:07,527
Here you go. Cat, TPT said that that

173
00:14:07,527 --> 00:14:10,287
was the stop Samsung app for-- Max,

174
00:14:10,407 --> 00:14:12,927
what are you doing, buddy?Hey, Maximus.

175
00:14:14,247 --> 00:14:16,727
Hey, Granddaddy. Hey,

176
00:14:16,727 --> 00:14:19,687
Granddaddy, look at me, buddy. Hey,

177
00:14:19,687 --> 00:14:20,887
old man. He's looking on the chick.

178
00:14:24,607 --> 00:14:26,167
Max, here, I'll make you bigger.

179
00:14:27,927 --> 00:14:30,327
Max, look at him. He can look. He

180
00:14:30,327 --> 00:14:32,327
watches. There's a blonde chick walking

181
00:14:32,407 --> 00:14:34,487
by, too, though. Yeah.

182
00:14:35,767 --> 00:14:37,407
Here's Walmart here. If you can show the

183
00:14:37,447 --> 00:14:39,687
treats on the on the screen, he'll look

184
00:14:39,687 --> 00:14:42,248
at you. I bet you anything. Watch. What,

185
00:14:42,488 --> 00:14:45,328
babe?Max, look. What's that?I've got

186
00:14:45,328 --> 00:14:47,288
this. I'm working on this project. Is it

187
00:14:47,288 --> 00:14:49,448
okay if I move these forward?Hold on one

188
00:14:49,528 --> 00:14:52,208
second. All right,

189
00:14:52,728 --> 00:14:55,408
so we were just-- Send anybody. That's

190
00:14:55,408 --> 00:14:57,208
very sweet of you to say that to them.

191
00:14:58,888 --> 00:15:00,648
Hi, I'm his first little girlfriend.

192
00:15:02,808 --> 00:15:05,608
My name is-- I'm joking, sorry.

193
00:15:06,728 --> 00:15:09,208
I can't tell right now.

194
00:15:10,488 --> 00:15:12,688
I hope that I can pay for all this stuff.

195
00:15:12,688 --> 00:15:15,648
Uh That's wonderful. Yes,

196
00:15:17,128 --> 00:15:20,088
thank you. Pages

197
00:15:20,088 --> 00:15:20,888
on Hawaiian bread.

198
00:15:25,208 --> 00:15:27,848
I have a thing. Snack out. They're

199
00:15:28,368 --> 00:15:30,968
here. I appreciate that. Anyway.

200
00:15:34,928 --> 00:15:37,368
Next. Uh He's raising it up in the rain.

201
00:15:37,728 --> 00:15:40,328
He raises it up, and he's got GPT hold

202
00:15:40,408 --> 00:15:43,288
update with him. So this is our

203
00:15:43,288 --> 00:15:45,208
neighborhood Walmart, and

204
00:15:46,728 --> 00:15:48,728
Unique is not here today.

205
00:15:49,808 --> 00:15:50,888
She's not here.

206
00:15:53,448 --> 00:15:55,568
Hey. Whenever you do stuff like that,

207
00:15:55,768 --> 00:15:57,768
sometimes?Just taking him on a tour.

208
00:15:58,728 --> 00:16:00,168
Okay, got it. AI. Where

209
00:16:02,248 --> 00:16:04,008
is it?I was taking my little guy on a

210
00:16:04,008 --> 00:16:06,928
tour. That's it. He's in the car out

211
00:16:06,928 --> 00:16:09,848
there. Ohh So, but this

212
00:16:09,848 --> 00:16:12,328
is fun. So I put this on my video blog

213
00:16:12,648 --> 00:16:15,208
in, like when I'm in Walmart, this

214
00:16:16,368 --> 00:16:18,968
like serendipitously doing these like

215
00:16:18,968 --> 00:16:21,368
little things. So when people hold up in

216
00:16:21,368 --> 00:16:23,368
like a hundred or a thousand years,

217
00:16:24,568 --> 00:16:25,768
That's why I do

218
00:16:29,928 --> 00:16:32,408
it. And she's in the Cadillac up there.

219
00:16:34,648 --> 00:16:36,168
Hi, little commander.

220
00:16:37,448 --> 00:16:38,489
Commodore.

221
00:16:40,809 --> 00:16:42,329
How are you guys doing today?

222
00:16:45,529 --> 00:16:48,169
Ohh We're blessed in many, many

223
00:16:48,169 --> 00:16:48,729
ways. Sorry.

224
00:16:56,409 --> 00:16:59,289
Well, I thank God as much as I can on any

225
00:16:59,289 --> 00:17:01,129
given day, a reasonable amount, but I

226
00:17:01,129 --> 00:17:03,129
also thank Mother Gaia or

227
00:17:04,329 --> 00:17:07,049
like, you know, we go to Enterprise Dog

228
00:17:07,049 --> 00:17:09,689
Park, mostly is our

229
00:17:09,689 --> 00:17:12,409
preferred venue for celebrating

230
00:17:13,289 --> 00:17:16,089
Mother Earth and all that is wonderful.

231
00:17:17,689 --> 00:17:20,409
I highly recommend that if you don't have

232
00:17:20,409 --> 00:17:22,489
a dog that you get a dog just so you can

233
00:17:22,489 --> 00:17:24,049
go to Enterprise Dog Park.

234
00:17:26,889 --> 00:17:29,529
HuhWhere are you visiting

235
00:17:29,529 --> 00:17:32,169
from?You know

236
00:17:42,689 --> 00:17:44,769
Oh, and this is an Elon Musk thing, by

237
00:17:44,769 --> 00:17:46,609
the way, in the journal. His room.

238
00:17:47,089 --> 00:17:49,009
Whatever you want to call it. It was a

239
00:17:49,089 --> 00:17:51,009
different- Yeah, Portal. Well, portal

240
00:17:51,009 --> 00:17:53,129
would be the actual name. And I've been

241
00:17:53,129 --> 00:17:55,049
so embarrassed to say it out loud that

242
00:17:55,289 --> 00:17:57,289
everybody would laugh at me or lock me

243
00:17:57,289 --> 00:18:00,089
up. You know, I

244
00:18:00,089 --> 00:18:02,329
only told my aunt. So tell me what

245
00:18:02,329 --> 00:18:04,489
happened. Something's not right,

246
00:18:04,489 --> 00:18:06,489
something scary in that room.

247
00:18:07,049 --> 00:18:10,009
Describe what you see and what happens.

248
00:18:10,409 --> 00:18:12,009
I went to the edge of the doorway,

249
00:18:13,249 --> 00:18:15,289
and I peeked in there, and I was afraid

250
00:18:15,289 --> 00:18:17,929
just to peek. And there was

251
00:18:17,929 --> 00:18:19,769
something happening in there, like a

252
00:18:19,769 --> 00:18:21,929
sci-fi movie. And there was something, he

253
00:18:21,929 --> 00:18:23,929
set him up like a little Stonehenge on

254
00:18:23,929 --> 00:18:26,689
his bed, and he was tiny, like I told

255
00:18:26,689 --> 00:18:28,849
you, so tiny. And he was jumping up and

256
00:18:28,849 --> 00:18:30,689
down, and he was saying, Moon, come play

257
00:18:30,689 --> 00:18:33,449
with my friends! Okay,

258
00:18:34,209 --> 00:18:35,930
that right there says he knew exactly

259
00:18:35,930 --> 00:18:38,810
what he was doing. It wasn't like

260
00:18:39,130 --> 00:18:42,010
he accidentally opened a portal

261
00:18:42,210 --> 00:18:44,650
and didn't know what he had friends.

262
00:18:47,610 --> 00:18:50,490
So, um, I peeked in there. And I was

263
00:18:50,490 --> 00:18:52,810
so scared. I'm embarrassed to tell this

264
00:18:52,810 --> 00:18:55,730
I'm so ridiculous, like weird. And he

265
00:18:55,730 --> 00:18:58,690
was being lifted, and he was starting

266
00:18:58,970 --> 00:19:01,890
to go-- he was being lifted, and

267
00:19:02,050 --> 00:19:02,490
like I was-- he

268
00:19:05,690 --> 00:19:06,730
was being lifted

269
00:19:09,050 --> 00:19:12,010
and being sucked in. I know

270
00:19:12,010 --> 00:19:14,490
this sounds ridiculous, but my aunt told

271
00:19:14,490 --> 00:19:16,010
me, don't let nothing happen to that

272
00:19:16,010 --> 00:19:18,410
effing little--kid.

273
00:19:19,290 --> 00:19:21,330
And normally, I would never let anything

274
00:19:21,330 --> 00:19:22,970
happen to a child that was watching. I

275
00:19:22,970 --> 00:19:25,730
would run between them in a pitbull. And

276
00:19:25,730 --> 00:19:28,330
I said, the way she said it, I said, Why?

277
00:19:28,770 --> 00:19:30,650
And she goes, She's gonna rule the world

278
00:19:30,650 --> 00:19:33,210
someday. I'm like, What, Jim?What do you

279
00:19:33,250 --> 00:19:35,650
mean?Why?And she said, Don't you know

280
00:19:35,650 --> 00:19:37,610
nothing there, the Illuminati. She would

281
00:19:37,610 --> 00:19:39,610
always do that to me, but she'd say,

282
00:19:39,610 --> 00:19:41,770
Don't let nothing happen to him. He's

283
00:19:41,770 --> 00:19:44,290
gonna rule the world someday. And I was

284
00:19:44,290 --> 00:19:47,050
like, That kid?You know,

285
00:19:47,050 --> 00:19:48,970
so I grabbed his little arm

286
00:19:50,170 --> 00:19:52,730
and I got sucked in. I got sucked into,

287
00:19:53,210 --> 00:19:55,450
it's like we went up and then we went

288
00:19:55,450 --> 00:19:58,330
down and it was dark in there,

289
00:19:58,330 --> 00:19:59,530
but it was glowing.

290
00:20:01,530 --> 00:20:03,970
And I can only tell you that

291
00:20:03,970 --> 00:20:06,730
whenI remember my peripheral

292
00:20:06,730 --> 00:20:08,170
vision because I was afraid to look at

293
00:20:08,170 --> 00:20:09,130
it, 'cause when you're a little kid, you

294
00:20:09,130 --> 00:20:10,650
look at the cartoons and there's a bad

295
00:20:10,650 --> 00:20:12,850
boogeyman in the Scooby-Doo, and you see

296
00:20:12,850 --> 00:20:14,490
its glowing eyes. It's like, Don't look

297
00:20:14,490 --> 00:20:16,250
at his eyes, he'll get you. And I

298
00:20:16,250 --> 00:20:18,450
remember that, oh, ohh if you don't look

299
00:20:18,450 --> 00:20:21,330
at their eyes, they can't get you.

300
00:20:21,330 --> 00:20:23,330
And I was being sucked in and sucked

301
00:20:23,330 --> 00:20:25,850
down, and I had his little arm, and it

302
00:20:25,850 --> 00:20:28,090
was weird because there was no bottom.

303
00:20:29,450 --> 00:20:31,290
And there were these creatures in there.

304
00:20:31,730 --> 00:20:33,931
And they were giant, and they were

305
00:20:33,931 --> 00:20:36,691
semi-shaped like humans. They were

306
00:20:36,731 --> 00:20:39,051
glorious. They weren't like

307
00:20:39,051 --> 00:20:41,131
smeagles or any creepy little demon

308
00:20:41,131 --> 00:20:43,931
dudes. They were like beautiful, ancient

309
00:20:45,411 --> 00:20:47,771
creatures that moved in a different time.

310
00:20:47,971 --> 00:20:50,411
And they were giant.

311
00:20:51,691 --> 00:20:54,411
And like they had a different head.

312
00:20:54,811 --> 00:20:57,451
Like there was a bird head and like a cat

313
00:20:57,451 --> 00:21:00,011
head and a jackal head. And

314
00:21:00,651 --> 00:21:02,331
I would compare them because I'm not

315
00:21:02,331 --> 00:21:04,411
super educated to like Egyptian type of

316
00:21:04,411 --> 00:21:07,371
things. Okay, after

317
00:21:07,371 --> 00:21:10,331
he did that opening the portal

318
00:21:10,331 --> 00:21:13,251
thing, I didn't tell

319
00:21:13,251 --> 00:21:16,171
what he did. And then I asked one of my

320
00:21:16,251 --> 00:21:18,691
other, the head mother of the

321
00:21:18,691 --> 00:21:21,491
Santeria, the head mother of the

322
00:21:21,491 --> 00:21:23,451
Santeria. And I think she's the head

323
00:21:23,451 --> 00:21:24,851
mother of those people that are Southern

324
00:21:24,851 --> 00:21:26,571
borders, creating,

325
00:21:28,011 --> 00:21:30,971
they're calling them in. Okay, they they

326
00:21:30,971 --> 00:21:32,971
paid for this a long time ago. But I

327
00:21:32,971 --> 00:21:35,131
said, is he the Antichrist?

328
00:21:36,251 --> 00:21:38,971
And she didn't blink. She said, no.

329
00:21:40,491 --> 00:21:42,491
But he won't present the mark. When you

330
00:21:42,491 --> 00:21:45,051
see him do that. She said

331
00:21:45,131 --> 00:21:48,091
that?She said that. The stage

332
00:21:48,091 --> 00:21:49,771
will be set for the Antichrist to step

333
00:21:49,771 --> 00:21:52,371
forward. So August 28th,

334
00:21:52,411 --> 00:21:55,011
2020, Elon Musk presented the neural

335
00:21:55,011 --> 00:21:57,931
link. UmmNow, is

336
00:21:57,931 --> 00:22:00,171
the mark of the beast, the image of the

337
00:22:00,171 --> 00:22:02,091
beast to be worshipped?Are they the same

338
00:22:02,091 --> 00:22:04,491
thing?Now, I know how... Okay, so...

339
00:22:13,171 --> 00:22:14,851
Just briefly...

340
00:22:16,611 --> 00:22:18,531
I don't know, I just feel like I have a

341
00:22:18,531 --> 00:22:21,011
synchronicity with Elon and I really do

342
00:22:21,011 --> 00:22:22,891
have a new answer to life, the universe

343
00:22:22,891 --> 00:22:25,811
and everything. It is 53 and I

344
00:22:25,811 --> 00:22:27,731
can tell you how it's in my journals

345
00:22:28,051 --> 00:22:30,652
anyhow. Hey,

346
00:22:31,132 --> 00:22:34,052
Ahmed, you have the remote. I gave it

347
00:22:34,052 --> 00:22:36,972
to you. It's a white remote. Ok, I was

348
00:22:36,972 --> 00:22:39,772
looking for it. I couldn't find it. It's

349
00:22:39,772 --> 00:22:42,012
very frustrating. You can play

350
00:22:42,012 --> 00:22:44,652
Netflix. There is stuff on Netflix. You

351
00:22:44,652 --> 00:22:46,772
can find anything on Netflix you want to

352
00:22:46,772 --> 00:22:48,812
watch. Play it, because I have this. Play

353
00:22:48,812 --> 00:22:50,492
it, I want to see Wednesday. I want to

354
00:22:50,492 --> 00:22:53,412
see that. Here, Wednesday. That

355
00:22:53,412 --> 00:22:55,932
looks cool, kind of hot. I like the

356
00:22:55,932 --> 00:22:58,892
whole, kind of,Your

357
00:22:59,292 --> 00:23:02,172
phone is playing. It's Call to

358
00:23:02,172 --> 00:23:02,652
Prayer.

359
00:23:05,772 --> 00:23:06,732
Do you have to hear it?

360
00:23:09,532 --> 00:23:11,532
Okay, we're watching Happy Gilmore 2.

361
00:23:16,732 --> 00:23:18,572
But I'm making a video right now, by the

362
00:23:18,572 --> 00:23:19,532
way, just so you know.

363
00:23:21,932 --> 00:23:24,892
So go back to sleep. Oh yeah.

364
00:23:26,612 --> 00:23:28,332
That's Ahmed, by the way. He's from

365
00:23:28,332 --> 00:23:30,932
Egypt. He's my, one of my soul

366
00:23:31,292 --> 00:23:33,292
brothers. Anyhow, and I...

367
00:23:35,372 --> 00:23:37,212
It's for a story for another day.

368
00:23:40,412 --> 00:23:41,932
Oh, we were right here.

369
00:23:44,012 --> 00:23:44,212
Huh

370
00:23:47,052 --> 00:23:49,612
I didn't get arrested. That was bullshitI

371
00:23:49,612 --> 00:23:52,492
mean baloney. It was baloney.

372
00:23:52,572 --> 00:23:55,532
There's a med. Do you want to say hello?

373
00:23:55,532 --> 00:23:57,972
I can't. I'm back. I

374
00:23:59,132 --> 00:24:02,012
know. Very true. So this is

375
00:24:02,012 --> 00:24:04,092
me driving through Clearwater right here.

376
00:24:04,452 --> 00:24:07,292
Look, driving through Clearwater?I'm.

377
00:24:07,852 --> 00:24:10,732
Look at this. Ain't a reason

378
00:24:11,412 --> 00:24:13,532
that I see it now in this version

379
00:24:16,572 --> 00:24:18,492
That's our production bite. No, that's

380
00:24:18,492 --> 00:24:20,572
the whole point of this show. We're in HS

381
00:24:20,572 --> 00:24:23,052
Hangout, or in this case, we're in

382
00:24:23,052 --> 00:24:25,452
Wayne's World's Hangout. We're in the man

383
00:24:25,452 --> 00:24:28,213
cave. Mostly, man cave.

384
00:24:41,323 --> 00:24:43,283
Now note this guy right here was holding

385
00:24:43,283 --> 00:24:46,173
this. And he was there for like

386
00:24:46,173 --> 00:24:48,333
days. I need to go back and see him and.

387
00:24:57,853 --> 00:25:00,293
So the goal was to bring Minka out with

388
00:25:00,333 --> 00:25:03,053
him, if you can hear me over that here.

389
00:25:05,773 --> 00:25:08,173
Okay, so here I'm just hanging out with

390
00:25:08,173 --> 00:25:10,733
the old man out there on the shore there

391
00:25:11,853 --> 00:25:14,093
and um

392
00:25:14,893 --> 00:25:17,373
I mean on the sidewalk there and I kind

393
00:25:17,373 --> 00:25:18,653
of sat there from

394
00:25:20,253 --> 00:25:22,413
right the time stamp right here

395
00:25:23,133 --> 00:25:24,733
is 1:40:11

396
00:25:27,373 --> 00:25:29,533
so I go from 1:39 I

397
00:25:38,953 --> 00:25:40,753
spent all this time just kind of hanging

398
00:25:40,753 --> 00:25:42,553
out with them here on the thing.

399
00:25:44,793 --> 00:25:46,713
Just watching all the people walk by.

400
00:25:50,573 --> 00:25:53,453
Ah, nobody. Oh wait,

401
00:25:53,453 --> 00:25:53,853
here.

402
00:26:04,643 --> 00:26:06,483
Okay, so I was making a royal fool of

403
00:26:06,483 --> 00:26:08,843
myself. Look, Look at this, this is me in

404
00:26:09,123 --> 00:26:11,363
downtown Clearwater. This guy's just

405
00:26:11,363 --> 00:26:13,363
playing with his freaking baseball card

406
00:26:13,363 --> 00:26:14,003
collection.

407
00:26:19,603 --> 00:26:19,763
Look.

408
00:26:45,134 --> 00:26:46,334
I'm trying to find anybody...

409
00:26:48,254 --> 00:26:50,974
Cheers! I missed

410
00:26:51,294 --> 00:26:53,054
out... Angel... Okay...

411
00:26:58,654 --> 00:26:59,254
I met Norm...

412
00:27:02,494 --> 00:27:04,534
What's the new rule?If you find that you

413
00:27:04,534 --> 00:27:07,374
need them in any limits, not

414
00:27:07,574 --> 00:27:09,934
requirements. I always drive fast enough

415
00:27:10,094 --> 00:27:11,814
not to piss anybody off, but sometimes

416
00:27:12,974 --> 00:27:13,734
I'll turn

417
00:27:19,054 --> 00:27:20,334
that way down.

418
00:27:22,014 --> 00:27:24,654
All right. Oh. Oh, I

419
00:27:24,654 --> 00:27:25,254
love this.

420
00:27:36,494 --> 00:27:38,734
Okay, here we go. We're going across the

421
00:27:38,734 --> 00:27:40,734
bridge. Let's get me out of the way here.

422
00:27:41,934 --> 00:27:44,014
I look up with you. I go,

423
00:27:45,614 --> 00:27:47,934
uh, it's so pretty.

424
00:27:49,294 --> 00:27:51,134
It's so pretty.

425
00:27:57,134 --> 00:27:57,174
ohh

426
00:28:06,574 --> 00:28:08,574
It's on a really big screen in front of

427
00:28:08,574 --> 00:28:11,454
me, which, it's almost like

428
00:28:11,454 --> 00:28:12,054
being there.

429
00:28:16,654 --> 00:28:18,534
This is my original song, by the way, I

430
00:28:18,534 --> 00:28:18,934
wrote it.

431
00:28:28,575 --> 00:28:30,455
Oh, ohh this whole video is viewable. You

432
00:28:30,455 --> 00:28:33,415
can go fast forward or rewind through

433
00:28:33,415 --> 00:28:34,895
it to your heart's content.

434
00:28:37,295 --> 00:28:39,095
Keep in mind that I was a little nutty

435
00:28:39,095 --> 00:28:41,615
and not just manic. Not like, like

436
00:28:41,695 --> 00:28:44,015
literally actually manic, okay?And I'm

437
00:28:44,015 --> 00:28:46,335
still kind of manic, but not really. I'm

438
00:28:46,335 --> 00:28:48,735
mostly tired because I got the crap beat

439
00:28:48,735 --> 00:28:50,895
out of me in jail andDon't

440
00:28:55,295 --> 00:28:56,015
learn feelings.

441
00:28:59,215 --> 00:29:00,455
I mean, there might be a lawsuit

442
00:29:00,455 --> 00:29:02,015
training, but mainly just for the foot

443
00:29:02,015 --> 00:29:04,535
head who put the knife on me in the first

444
00:29:04,535 --> 00:29:07,375
place. That was the wrong move,

445
00:29:07,455 --> 00:29:10,415
buddy. That was the wrong move, because

446
00:29:11,055 --> 00:29:14,015
there's like a statute of limitations,

447
00:29:14,015 --> 00:29:15,775
so any time they can, I mean.

448
00:29:18,575 --> 00:29:21,295
Multiple witnesses saw you pull a knife

449
00:29:21,295 --> 00:29:23,935
on me with my hands behind my

450
00:29:24,015 --> 00:29:26,055
back and I wasn't even threatening you

451
00:29:26,175 --> 00:29:27,775
dude at all

452
00:29:28,815 --> 00:29:31,495
Why you would pull a knife on me and

453
00:29:31,535 --> 00:29:33,615
threaten my life no less

454
00:29:36,575 --> 00:29:39,535
That's Literally actually assault with

455
00:29:39,535 --> 00:29:41,935
a deadly weapon. It's a It's a

456
00:29:41,935 --> 00:29:43,775
second-degree felony

457
00:29:44,655 --> 00:29:47,535
Just sayingThat's the actual

458
00:29:47,535 --> 00:29:49,775
felony that you perpetrated on me,

459
00:29:50,495 --> 00:29:53,295
sir. Not to mention the felonies I

460
00:29:53,295 --> 00:29:55,375
saw you perpetrate on my next door

461
00:29:55,375 --> 00:29:58,335
neighbor. And I'm just reminding

462
00:29:58,335 --> 00:29:59,215
you again...

463
00:30:01,215 --> 00:30:03,695
I haven't forgot. This is the

464
00:30:03,695 --> 00:30:06,015
victory lap for that. And I spent a week

465
00:30:06,015 --> 00:30:08,335
in jail because of the mania I got as a

466
00:30:08,335 --> 00:30:09,615
result of your dips...

467
00:30:14,815 --> 00:30:16,975
And I'm just trying not to say anything

468
00:30:16,975 --> 00:30:17,615
unkind.

469
00:30:21,936 --> 00:30:23,536
But as far as I can tell...

470
00:30:24,896 --> 00:30:27,696
Yeah. I've never met a former

471
00:30:27,696 --> 00:30:30,496
service member that would behave

472
00:30:30,496 --> 00:30:33,416
remotely like that high head. Dude is a

473
00:30:33,416 --> 00:30:33,976
straight up...

474
00:30:36,496 --> 00:30:39,376
Watch the new world grow. And I tried

475
00:30:39,376 --> 00:30:41,376
to frame it like, you know, he's got...

476
00:30:41,736 --> 00:30:44,176
Like good shepherding skills or he's a

477
00:30:44,176 --> 00:30:47,056
good shepherd, but he's got a tight ship.

478
00:30:47,056 --> 00:30:49,936
But I mean, the guy's a helicopter parent

479
00:30:49,936 --> 00:30:52,816
with his dogs and his dogs are vicious

480
00:30:52,816 --> 00:30:55,776
and really did attack another park goer's

481
00:30:55,776 --> 00:30:57,936
dog. And yeah,

482
00:30:58,176 --> 00:31:00,976
I did identify him because that's what

483
00:31:00,976 --> 00:31:03,856
any good citizen would do. If their

484
00:31:03,856 --> 00:31:06,816
dog attacked another dog. And you know,

485
00:31:06,816 --> 00:31:09,216
my dog was attacked once just recently in

486
00:31:09,216 --> 00:31:10,736
the park and everybody's like, why didn't

487
00:31:10,736 --> 00:31:13,136
you?I was like, cause the kid was 25 and

488
00:31:13,136 --> 00:31:15,976
I didn't feel like ruining his day. And

489
00:31:15,976 --> 00:31:18,176
if it was me that was bent like that, it

490
00:31:18,216 --> 00:31:20,656
would be like a four alarm fire. But

491
00:31:20,976 --> 00:31:23,896
Daisy's a pit bull, sort of. And

492
00:31:24,376 --> 00:31:26,576
while she didn't instigate it and while

493
00:31:26,576 --> 00:31:29,456
it hurt. There was no hard feelings in

494
00:31:29,456 --> 00:31:32,176
that kid and and the dog, whatever. But

495
00:31:32,176 --> 00:31:34,616
in the case of Shredder, this David

496
00:31:34,616 --> 00:31:36,896
Rosen's dog, yeah, that dog is

497
00:31:36,896 --> 00:31:39,856
vicious and it

498
00:31:39,856 --> 00:31:42,176
did bite another dog at the park and I

499
00:31:42,176 --> 00:31:43,976
was not a part of it at all. But I

500
00:31:43,976 --> 00:31:46,736
observed this guy's a menace in

501
00:31:46,736 --> 00:31:49,616
this place and at the park, wherever

502
00:31:49,616 --> 00:31:52,496
he goes, he is a menace and he's

503
00:31:52,496 --> 00:31:54,896
got anger issues out in the wazoo.

504
00:31:55,296 --> 00:31:57,696
And I just can't believe for a moment

505
00:31:57,696 --> 00:31:59,936
that those anger issues have anything to

506
00:31:59,936 --> 00:32:02,896
do with actual service in

507
00:32:02,896 --> 00:32:05,856
any armed forces of this United States of

508
00:32:05,856 --> 00:32:08,736
America. Correct me if

509
00:32:08,776 --> 00:32:11,696
I'm wrong, I put my DD214

510
00:32:11,696 --> 00:32:13,896
up on this channel so you can see it and

511
00:32:13,936 --> 00:32:15,776
I'll block it out to you. I've got it in

512
00:32:15,776 --> 00:32:18,417
my bag, all my certificates, everything

513
00:32:18,417 --> 00:32:21,377
else. I'm not anything

514
00:32:21,377 --> 00:32:23,777
special, but I'm pointing out that this

515
00:32:23,777 --> 00:32:26,497
whole thing was instigated by that

516
00:32:26,497 --> 00:32:29,377
butthead. Straight up. That's the

517
00:32:29,377 --> 00:32:32,097
whole thing that started this. And yeah,

518
00:32:32,097 --> 00:32:34,257
I let it do it, but I'm also a veteran.

519
00:32:34,257 --> 00:32:36,697
You know, I'm also, like, I don't believe

520
00:32:36,697 --> 00:32:38,497
I'm entitled to anything, but when

521
00:32:38,497 --> 00:32:40,737
somebody flashes a freaking weapon in my

522
00:32:40,817 --> 00:32:43,617
face, instead of listening to me say,

523
00:32:43,777 --> 00:32:45,777
yeah, I'm actually a veteran, I mean, I

524
00:32:45,777 --> 00:32:48,097
can literally pull it up on my phone, but

525
00:32:48,177 --> 00:32:50,497
you're. Flashing a knife in my

526
00:32:50,497 --> 00:32:53,457
face again. He had a knife in his

527
00:32:53,457 --> 00:32:56,417
hand multiple witnesses saw it This is an

528
00:32:56,417 --> 00:32:59,217
accusation It's all I mean I

529
00:32:59,217 --> 00:33:01,657
have all the timings and everything the

530
00:33:01,697 --> 00:33:04,417
guy is yeah, he's a loose cannon

531
00:33:04,417 --> 00:33:07,217
rolling around our deck That's a

532
00:33:07,217 --> 00:33:10,097
fact I'll point out that

533
00:33:10,097 --> 00:33:12,817
this was the day before Hulk Hogan died

534
00:33:13,297 --> 00:33:15,537
and I'm going like two miles an hour

535
00:33:15,537 --> 00:33:16,737
throughClearwater.

536
00:33:19,937 --> 00:33:22,497
Yeah. You know what?Because Hulk Hogan's

537
00:33:22,497 --> 00:33:24,257
a great man. I did not know he was going

538
00:33:24,257 --> 00:33:25,697
to pass away that night.

539
00:33:32,017 --> 00:33:33,537
But this is literally the day

540
00:33:35,097 --> 00:33:37,177
before he died. And this is

541
00:33:38,017 --> 00:33:38,417
his

542
00:33:40,737 --> 00:33:43,697
shot right here. And it should be into

543
00:33:43,697 --> 00:33:46,257
the Hulkster right here. Though we

544
00:33:46,257 --> 00:33:48,017
haven't changed to the whole... Can

545
00:33:51,697 --> 00:33:52,657
you hear me?Yep.

546
00:33:55,937 --> 00:33:58,257
I got you.

547
00:34:07,537 --> 00:34:09,457
I did a slow-bo drive-by.

548
00:34:13,977 --> 00:34:14,297
Slow-bo.

549
00:34:26,338 --> 00:34:27,298
And I wrote this song.

550
00:34:29,778 --> 00:34:32,138
Now I'm really serious. Why is this

551
00:34:32,138 --> 00:34:32,738
guy... I

552
00:34:37,698 --> 00:34:40,138
really am actually bullish. And you can

553
00:34:40,138 --> 00:34:41,698
say it every once, but I am bullish.

554
00:34:43,618 --> 00:34:44,898
And I've broken it.

555
00:34:46,898 --> 00:34:48,418
And when I say I've broken it...

556
00:34:51,618 --> 00:34:54,298
So many hands have been broken on stiff

557
00:34:54,458 --> 00:34:54,818
skin.

558
00:34:57,778 --> 00:34:59,818
Yes, a lot of pants.

559
00:35:02,538 --> 00:35:04,178
I'm not the best fighter, but I've got

560
00:35:04,218 --> 00:35:05,378
the hardest bones.

561
00:35:07,978 --> 00:35:10,658
Yeah, look at this. One more round.

562
00:35:15,938 --> 00:35:17,498
Now I'm not gonna do that again, because

563
00:35:17,698 --> 00:35:18,938
I'm weird to build this track, and

564
00:35:18,938 --> 00:35:20,258
hopefully I get it fixed this morning.

565
00:35:21,378 --> 00:35:24,178
OK. And I'm

566
00:35:24,178 --> 00:35:25,458
lazy talking, all right. Now,

567
00:35:32,418 --> 00:35:34,698
you can find this is in the Soul Bus with

568
00:35:34,698 --> 00:35:36,898
the crashed windshield. That's where I

569
00:35:36,898 --> 00:35:38,338
used to work right now. That used to be

570
00:35:38,738 --> 00:35:40,458
the holiday in Surfside. I used to deal

571
00:35:40,818 --> 00:35:42,138
with David Jermaine

572
00:35:43,778 --> 00:35:44,418
for a short while.

573
00:35:46,738 --> 00:35:47,418
That's the holiday

574
00:35:56,898 --> 00:35:59,258
Okay, let's keep up fast forward. This is

575
00:35:59,258 --> 00:36:01,538
a lot of time. Okay,

576
00:36:02,098 --> 00:36:04,018
fast forward. Ohh

577
00:36:05,458 --> 00:36:06,018
Got the spirit

578
00:36:08,818 --> 00:36:11,778
turning right inside No sheer

579
00:36:11,778 --> 00:36:14,579
of shame can stop

580
00:36:14,579 --> 00:36:15,379
this rise

581
00:37:05,219 --> 00:37:07,259
This is the best beach in the world. It

582
00:37:07,299 --> 00:37:10,099
really is. And I love you guys. I just

583
00:37:10,099 --> 00:37:11,619
want to make sure that you didn't miss

584
00:37:11,619 --> 00:37:14,539
me. I'm back! Just

585
00:37:14,539 --> 00:37:16,579
making sure. I'll be back a few more

586
00:37:16,579 --> 00:37:17,059
times. One

587
00:37:22,339 --> 00:37:24,819
more time! Hey, Icor!

588
00:37:27,379 --> 00:37:29,619
In case you missed the last one. It's

589
00:37:29,619 --> 00:37:32,579
very super easy. It just takes a lifetime

590
00:37:32,979 --> 00:37:33,059
of

591
00:37:40,979 --> 00:37:41,459
like.

592
00:38:15,300 --> 00:38:17,180
RPE Soulcast blog is here.

593
00:38:18,740 --> 00:38:20,660
You can see my Genesis program.

594
00:38:22,580 --> 00:38:24,980
Like whatever, whatever, whatever. But

595
00:38:25,140 --> 00:38:27,900
the point is that I am legitimately a

596
00:38:27,900 --> 00:38:28,340
born atheist.

597
00:38:31,980 --> 00:38:34,180
I'm sorry about that. I'm

598
00:38:34,180 --> 00:38:36,900
legitimately a former atheist and I am

599
00:38:36,900 --> 00:38:39,100
legitimately a born again Christian

600
00:38:39,380 --> 00:38:41,860
hallelujah and I do not

601
00:38:41,860 --> 00:38:44,340
subscribe to anyoneBut I would

602
00:38:44,500 --> 00:38:46,740
very much love to be able to

603
00:38:47,460 --> 00:38:50,180
bury the hatchet, which never existed

604
00:38:50,180 --> 00:38:52,020
from my side for Rodney. But

605
00:38:52,740 --> 00:38:55,660
apparently these guys don't return calls.

606
00:38:55,660 --> 00:38:57,620
And when they did return calls and I was

607
00:38:57,620 --> 00:39:00,580
like, I am, she promptly hung up on me.

608
00:39:00,580 --> 00:39:02,580
No hard feelings. Again, I am

609
00:39:02,580 --> 00:39:05,300
legitimately a former parishioner of your

610
00:39:05,300 --> 00:39:07,980
church. You did trespass me. It didn't

611
00:39:07,980 --> 00:39:10,940
cost me $717.20

612
00:39:11,460 --> 00:39:14,260
in impound fees. As well

613
00:39:14,300 --> 00:39:16,980
as $100 bond for that, plus

614
00:39:16,980 --> 00:39:19,860
court fees, plus a lot of pain

615
00:39:19,860 --> 00:39:22,020
from having to actually physically walk

616
00:39:22,020 --> 00:39:24,740
around for 32 more hours in a cell

617
00:39:25,140 --> 00:39:28,100
in the in the inappropriately

618
00:39:28,100 --> 00:39:30,740
assigned ghillie suit or what you would

619
00:39:30,740 --> 00:39:33,580
call the turtle suit. Yeah, so that

620
00:39:33,580 --> 00:39:36,020
was really effed up, you guys. Just

621
00:39:36,020 --> 00:39:38,420
saying. I literally went there. I showed

622
00:39:38,420 --> 00:39:40,180
you that in the last video. I'm not going

623
00:39:40,180 --> 00:39:42,740
to go back there again. Rodney, I would

624
00:39:42,740 --> 00:39:44,660
really appreciate it if you would give me

625
00:39:44,700 --> 00:39:47,660
a call. 727-256-4413, give

626
00:39:47,660 --> 00:39:48,300
me a call.

627
00:39:49,300 --> 00:39:52,260
727-256-4413, give me a

628
00:39:52,260 --> 00:39:55,180
call. Please. That's all I'm saying.

629
00:39:55,180 --> 00:39:56,980
You give me a call. Every single thing in

630
00:39:57,220 --> 00:39:59,660
that movie happens to you. Or anybody

631
00:39:59,660 --> 00:40:02,460
else. I might answer it or I might not. I

632
00:40:02,580 --> 00:40:04,380
mean, I, what do I care?

633
00:40:08,421 --> 00:40:10,181
Ohh So this is, but here's where it gets

634
00:40:10,181 --> 00:40:10,501
better.

635
00:40:13,141 --> 00:40:15,941
Okay, here's me getting pulled over by

636
00:40:15,941 --> 00:40:18,821
the entire Clearwater

637
00:40:18,821 --> 00:40:20,941
Police Department and this will be on cop

638
00:40:20,941 --> 00:40:23,541
cam somewhere. So please pick it up.

639
00:40:24,461 --> 00:40:26,741
And the whole point of this was actually

640
00:40:27,221 --> 00:40:30,021
to marketReady Player

What's up, sir, how you doing?Uh, blessed

652
00:41:04,501 --> 00:41:06,261
by God, sir. We're just making

653

sure you're good. I'm good. You got a

654
00:41:09,061 --> 00:41:10,541
crack in your... I can't really say or

655
00:41:10,541 --> 00:41:11,581
you'll think I'm crazy. Are you diagnosed

656
00:41:11,581 --> 00:41:13,141
with any mental

657
00:41:14,421 --> 00:41:15,461
health disability or anything?I'm a 70%

658
00:41:15,461 --> 00:41:18,421
service disabled veteran. Okay, do

659
00:41:18,421 --> 00:41:21,381
you suffer?Okay, let's

660
00:41:22,661 --> 00:41:24,821
see. Uh, right. I'm diagnosed with PTSD

661
00:41:24,901 --> 00:41:26,541
and several other things, you can look it

662
00:41:26,541 --> 00:41:28,901
up on my record. All right, do you take

663
00:41:28,901 --> 00:41:30,501
your medications and all that?Always. Are

664
00:41:30,501 --> 00:41:32,341
you feeling okay?All right, have a good

665
00:41:32,341 --> 00:41:35,221
day. All right. Do you have your

666
00:41:35,221 --> 00:41:35,741
driver's license?

667
00:41:39,581 --> 00:41:40,581
Of course I do. All right. All rightHow's

668
00:41:40,581 --> 00:41:42,581
my sex offender registration thing right

669
00:41:42,581 --> 00:41:45,501
here, too?Would that work for you?If I

670
00:41:45,501 --> 00:41:46,701
can see your driver's license?Yeah, I'll

671
00:41:46,701 --> 00:41:49,301
give it to you. Thank goodness I still

672
00:41:49,381 --> 00:41:51,541
have all that now. You want to hear the

673
00:41:51,541 --> 00:41:54,021
sign rep?Brady Judd?

674
00:41:54,541 --> 00:41:56,741
Yeah, they wrote a song. Brady

675
00:41:57,621 --> 00:41:58,941
Judd, it's true. I'm trying to remember

676
00:41:58,941 --> 00:42:00,341
it. That's why I'm driving around singing

677
00:42:00,341 --> 00:42:02,821
it. Yeah, but what I can

678
00:42:03,461 --> 00:42:05,862
say is I'm his biggest fan.

679
00:42:06,222 --> 00:42:09,062
Frequently. I am. I listen to his

680
00:42:09,062 --> 00:42:11,302
words all the time. And it that's my

681
00:42:11,302 --> 00:42:13,782
fifth element right there. Ohh

682
00:42:14,182 --> 00:42:16,022
Quite funny. I've got him somewhere. He

683
00:42:16,542 --> 00:42:18,502
generally speaking has some very good

684
00:42:18,502 --> 00:42:20,502
wisdom to a part along. That's nice right

685
00:42:20,742 --> 00:42:22,822
there. Oh ohh wait!

686
00:42:24,262 --> 00:42:25,862
What do I have in my pocket?

687
00:42:27,142 --> 00:42:29,062
I have a piece of anchor! In this case, I

688
00:42:29,062 --> 00:42:31,462
had a cracked windshield. Right. I didn't

689
00:42:31,462 --> 00:42:33,342
mean to do that. I was mad. I can't speak

690
00:42:33,382 --> 00:42:35,582
around it. So when I get crazy, I look at

691
00:42:35,582 --> 00:42:36,982
my anchor and my grandfather, he's

692
00:42:36,982 --> 00:42:39,822
sitting right there. Uh, and I had

693
00:42:39,822 --> 00:42:41,862
his glasses on, but they fell off when I

694
00:42:41,862 --> 00:42:44,462
went to the church last night. And...

695
00:42:45,102 --> 00:42:46,502
They didn't let me in. No hard feelings.

696
00:42:47,702 --> 00:42:49,462
My name is Kenneth Court, or you can call

697
00:42:49,462 --> 00:42:51,262
me under ratings. Yes, sir. Do you have a

698
00:42:51,262 --> 00:42:52,662
driver's license cashed?I sure

699
00:43:02,392 --> 00:43:04,632
do. Oops. Episode on the television in my

700
00:43:04,632 --> 00:43:05,272
apartment.

701
00:43:20,232 --> 00:43:22,022
Because... OK. Alright.

702
00:43:26,622 --> 00:43:27,862
Speedway now, but when I was here. I

703
00:43:27,942 --> 00:43:29,582
can't look at that. I mean I just, I was

704
00:43:29,582 --> 00:43:32,342
useful. I was really goofy. I

705
00:43:32,342 --> 00:43:34,022
was really good. Once you realize it, and

706
00:43:34,022 --> 00:43:34,662
then you realize.

707
00:43:38,102 --> 00:43:40,982
The glasses I left at the River last

708
00:43:41,302 --> 00:43:42,982
night, and I'm not lying, I'm not, I

709
00:43:42,982 --> 00:43:45,222
swear, I I love guys Rodney Brown,

710
00:43:46,182 --> 00:43:49,062
Rodney Howard Brown, very much,

711
00:43:49,222 --> 00:43:51,982
andOne of the reasons why I love him is

712
00:43:51,982 --> 00:43:53,942
'cause he's a mustard seed, apparently.

713
00:43:55,302 --> 00:43:57,102
Because he anointed me personally. I

714
00:43:57,102 --> 00:43:59,062
don't even know our feelings. I would, I

715
00:43:59,062 --> 00:44:01,622
am, I am this year and it was the best

716
00:44:01,742 --> 00:44:04,343
effort to. And oh my god, I

717
00:44:12,893 --> 00:44:13,453
mean... That's how!

718
00:44:20,953 --> 00:44:23,633
Man, this is a 71 piece. Thank you, God,

719
00:44:23,633 --> 00:44:26,153
for that one. But I will point out,

720
00:44:26,193 --> 00:44:28,983
there's a whole lot of dash campingother

721
00:44:29,023 --> 00:44:31,303
video for those channels that like that

722
00:44:31,303 --> 00:44:34,263
stuff go get it because it was

723
00:44:34,263 --> 00:44:36,103
really great I thought I did

724
00:44:36,623 --> 00:44:38,583
particularly well in my role

725
00:44:39,783 --> 00:44:42,423
and you know perhaps

726
00:44:43,303 --> 00:44:45,103
you might agree that strange things

727
00:44:45,143 --> 00:44:48,103
actually were afoot at the Circle K and

728
00:44:48,103 --> 00:44:50,343
I actually made them afoot at other

729
00:44:50,343 --> 00:44:52,743
Circle K's just so you know

730
00:44:53,783 --> 00:44:55,943
and uh anyhow

731
00:45:00,423 --> 00:45:02,023
I skedaddled out of there

732
00:45:04,183 --> 00:45:05,703
without raising a ruckus.

733
00:45:18,793 --> 00:45:20,793
You must stop.

734
00:46:10,984 --> 00:46:12,904
Ah, and then shortly thereafter I got

735
00:46:13,464 --> 00:46:15,704
beaten up by Officer

736
00:46:15,704 --> 00:46:18,144
Jeffrey Williams of the police

737
00:46:19,904 --> 00:46:22,264
department. No harm failings, sir.

738
00:46:23,144 --> 00:46:25,064
did just get a salute from me a couple of

739
00:46:25,064 --> 00:46:26,824
minutes prior to that I'm pretty sure if

740
00:46:26,864 --> 00:46:29,624
I'm getting that right. Anyhow,

741
00:46:30,344 --> 00:46:32,504
so that was the big day

742
00:46:33,464 --> 00:46:35,784
and that's what I'm uploading here where

743
00:46:35,784 --> 00:46:37,624
Strange Things were afoot if they're

744
00:46:37,624 --> 00:46:40,064
Circle K. Ah

745
00:46:40,784 --> 00:46:41,144
And

746
00:46:44,904 --> 00:46:47,544
then we have Brother Ken,

747
00:46:47,544 --> 00:46:49,544
Samwise Gamgee come in.

748
00:46:50,264 --> 00:46:52,784
Oh goodness. Samwise. The rest of the

749
00:46:52,784 --> 00:46:55,464
story. Yes, well I'm making a video right

750
00:46:55,464 --> 00:46:58,264
now, Samwise. How's it

751
00:47:00,184 --> 00:47:02,824
going?Ohh Well, I'm still making it

752
00:47:02,904 --> 00:47:05,344
while I'm finalizing the other one. Are

753
00:47:05,344 --> 00:47:06,664
you the big dog that scared everybody?

754
00:47:10,104 --> 00:47:12,424
And again, this is the ministry and we

755
00:47:12,424 --> 00:47:14,584
are not asking for anything. We're just

756
00:47:14,584 --> 00:47:17,464
sharing our vision of

757
00:47:17,464 --> 00:47:19,864
Angel OS and

758
00:47:20,584 --> 00:47:23,264
the upcoming release of the

759
00:47:23,264 --> 00:47:24,424
Angel OS

760
00:47:25,864 --> 00:47:28,344
and our

761
00:47:28,344 --> 00:47:31,304
ministry of going around and like

762
00:47:31,544 --> 00:47:33,784
hanging out with people that don't have

763
00:47:33,784 --> 00:47:36,664
anybody with our dogs and going to the

764
00:47:36,664 --> 00:47:39,144
dog park and looking at the sky

765
00:47:39,144 --> 00:47:41,664
mostly just enjoying

766
00:47:42,344 --> 00:47:45,304
driving our favorite Cadillac car

767
00:47:45,864 --> 00:47:48,264
or our favorite soap van which

768
00:47:49,144 --> 00:47:51,704
Chevy Express 1500, 2000 with

769
00:47:51,864 --> 00:47:54,824
233,000 miles on it. But

770
00:47:54,824 --> 00:47:56,744
we love ministering to people and

771
00:47:58,345 --> 00:48:00,345
however we can, if that's just hanging

772
00:48:00,345 --> 00:48:02,745
out with them, maybe giving them

773
00:48:02,985 --> 00:48:05,865
something. Hopefully we can bring

774
00:48:05,865 --> 00:48:08,025
some baseball card sleeves back to the to

775
00:48:08,105 --> 00:48:10,425
the guy downtown Clearwater. He's

776
00:48:11,065 --> 00:48:13,545
83 years old, he's been there for like 20

777
00:48:13,545 --> 00:48:16,265
years actually and he'swas a carny for

778
00:48:16,265 --> 00:48:18,745
24 years and he's from

779
00:48:18,745 --> 00:48:21,705
Kentucky and but I can't remember

780
00:48:22,585 --> 00:48:25,305
his name off the top of my head right

781
00:48:25,305 --> 00:48:28,025
now. Anyhow.

782
00:48:31,225 --> 00:48:33,545
Ah And here's another nighttime scene of

783
00:48:33,945 --> 00:48:34,665
downtown.

784
00:48:53,945 --> 00:48:55,305
I love Clearwater

785
00:49:00,425 --> 00:49:00,905
HuhI've been

786
00:49:04,025 --> 00:49:06,905
here all my life I love this

787
00:49:06,905 --> 00:49:09,865
place It's my

788
00:49:09,865 --> 00:49:11,945
favorite place in the world I'm glad I

789
00:49:11,945 --> 00:49:14,545
get to live here instead of anywhere else

790
00:49:21,055 --> 00:49:23,935
HuhDid you

791
00:49:23,935 --> 00:49:25,375
go to Clearwater High School?

792
00:49:27,705 --> 00:49:30,345
Park High School. Okay. Morgan

793
00:49:30,345 --> 00:49:33,025
Fitzgerald Middle. Park Flight

794
00:49:33,225 --> 00:49:33,705
Elementary.

795
00:49:38,705 --> 00:49:40,745
Yep, a lot of things change around here

796
00:49:40,905 --> 00:49:41,545
for three years.

797
00:49:51,225 --> 00:49:52,825
HuhDo you ever want

798
00:49:55,026 --> 00:49:56,186
to hear God laugh?Uh,

799
00:49:57,866 --> 00:49:59,786
I hear a guy laugh when I laugh.

800
00:50:03,906 --> 00:50:05,946
These dogs really want to go outside Ken.

801
00:50:05,946 --> 00:50:07,786
Can we help these dogs go out?Uh,

802
00:50:09,546 --> 00:50:12,386
get them on the leash?No. Ahmed needs to

803
00:50:12,426 --> 00:50:15,026
take them out. HuhAhmed needs to take

804
00:50:15,026 --> 00:50:16,226
them out soon. I said get them on

805
00:50:18,506 --> 00:50:19,546
the leash. Then you can control it.

806
00:50:25,206 --> 00:50:27,326
Believe it or not, I think Rich just took

807
00:50:27,366 --> 00:50:28,366
his chihuahuas now.

808
00:50:30,246 --> 00:50:32,926
Yeah, Rich is getting on my last

809
00:50:32,926 --> 00:50:33,446
nerve.

810
00:50:37,506 --> 00:50:39,146
don't do the thing, you know

811
00:50:40,506 --> 00:50:42,026
He just came out the door and seen a big

812
00:50:42,506 --> 00:50:44,346
German shepherd, you knowAnd then he

813
00:50:44,346 --> 00:50:46,106
spent five minutes yelling at me about

814
00:50:46,106 --> 00:50:47,706
it. I was like, okay.

815
00:50:49,066 --> 00:50:51,786
And anyhow. I

816
00:50:57,226 --> 00:50:59,146
mean, it's just a big misunderstanding.

817
00:50:59,146 --> 00:51:01,586
You didn't, but the idea is when you got

818
00:51:01,586 --> 00:51:03,626
a dog that big at the apartment complex,

819
00:51:04,186 --> 00:51:05,386
You have to have control over

820
00:51:07,306 --> 00:51:08,866
it. Uh, it's not my dog.

821
00:51:11,786 --> 00:51:12,426
Thank you.

822
00:51:17,706 --> 00:51:19,546
It's on, it's on buddy.

823
00:51:21,226 --> 00:51:23,866
It's not on me. I mean I, I realize that

824
00:51:24,106 --> 00:51:26,746
like I let him bring the dog here but.

825
00:51:30,106 --> 00:51:30,506
But

826
00:51:34,906 --> 00:51:36,146
They're his dogs. When they go out

827
00:51:39,306 --> 00:51:40,426
that door, they're out of your your

828
00:51:41,626 --> 00:51:44,426
apartment. Uh, this is our apartment now

829
00:51:44,426 --> 00:51:45,066
buddy.

830
00:51:47,626 --> 00:51:49,866
They're not my dogs either. That's the

831
00:51:49,866 --> 00:51:50,906
point I'm making.

832
00:51:52,427 --> 00:51:54,187
Because they're Imed's dogs.

833
00:51:55,307 --> 00:51:57,907
Imed's dogs. Oh, that's the guy over

834
00:51:58,027 --> 00:52:00,747
here. is here right now and he's sleeping

835
00:52:00,747 --> 00:52:01,387
on the couch.

836
00:52:08,627 --> 00:52:10,827
Um Except for one thing.

837
00:52:12,427 --> 00:52:15,387
My problem in this case is that Rich is a

838
00:52:15,387 --> 00:52:18,347
fag number one. And number two,

839
00:52:19,467 --> 00:52:21,747
no, but the separate issue is that his

840
00:52:21,747 --> 00:52:24,027
dog's on a leash and he's the

841
00:52:24,027 --> 00:52:26,507
last person to be telling me that.

842
00:52:28,227 --> 00:52:31,067
it doesn't matter these dogs are timid

843
00:52:31,147 --> 00:52:33,947
and they are I've known these dogs

844
00:52:33,947 --> 00:52:36,507
for years right

845
00:52:37,827 --> 00:52:38,027
right

846
00:52:42,027 --> 00:52:44,267
and you bring up very good points brother

847
00:52:44,267 --> 00:52:46,827
in Christ you do and I

848
00:52:46,827 --> 00:52:48,467
tend to want to agree with you

849
00:52:49,547 --> 00:52:51,547
but him yelling at me

850
00:52:53,547 --> 00:52:56,267
right and and like I said so if he wants

851
00:52:56,267 --> 00:52:58,907
to yell at me then he canhear me yell

852
00:52:58,907 --> 00:53:01,227
defamatory things that are

853
00:53:01,307 --> 00:53:04,107
absolutely 100% true about him and

854
00:53:04,107 --> 00:53:06,867
his complete lack of character. Because

855
00:53:06,867 --> 00:53:09,147
he is a total woke bleeding

856
00:53:09,387 --> 00:53:11,787
homosexual. And that's a factual

857
00:53:11,787 --> 00:53:13,467
statement. But that's his life, I can't

858
00:53:14,267 --> 00:53:16,587
control that. No, I'm all about having

859
00:53:16,587 --> 00:53:18,747
diversity of thought around me. I am

860
00:53:18,747 --> 00:53:20,707
totally about having diversity of thought

861
00:53:20,707 --> 00:53:23,627
around me. But, I...

862
00:53:24,427 --> 00:53:26,987
I will disagree with that

863
00:53:26,987 --> 00:53:29,547
and I definitely believe in no

864
00:53:29,547 --> 00:53:32,027
buts. No buts.

865
00:53:32,107 --> 00:53:34,947
Anyway, you know that. Did you look at my

866
00:53:35,027 --> 00:53:37,227
Facebook when I posted?No, I don't have

867
00:53:37,227 --> 00:53:40,107
Facebook. Oh, okay. I'll show you a

868
00:53:40,107 --> 00:53:42,347
picture and then I'll tell you. As a

869
00:53:42,347 --> 00:53:43,747
matter of fact, I just sent it to you. Umm

870
00:53:47,267 --> 00:53:48,507
Tell me what you see in the picture. I

871
00:53:51,028 --> 00:53:52,268
was sitting outside and I took it.

872
00:54:03,148 --> 00:54:05,868
Well, anyhow,

873
00:54:05,868 --> 00:54:07,548
here's a wrap right here.

874
00:54:09,788 --> 00:54:09,828
Uh

875
00:54:21,008 --> 00:54:23,968
Anyhow, that'll be all for this

876
00:54:23,968 --> 00:54:25,648
week, I guess, for the time being.

877
00:54:27,088 --> 00:54:29,728
Uh, we're at 5430.

878
00:54:31,488 --> 00:54:34,288
Alright. So,

879
00:54:34,768 --> 00:54:37,728
without much hoopla, that'll be

880
00:54:37,728 --> 00:54:39,748
this update. I hope you have a great one.

881
00:54:40,788 --> 00:54:42,268
Thanks for watching. If you did.
